This analytical tool delivers valuable information about RNA-protein interactions and RNA docking sites in proteins, both in vitro and in vivo. The identification of cross-linked peptides with oligonucleotides of different length leads to a combinatorial increase in search space. We demonstrate that the peptide retention time prediction tasks can be transferred to the task of cross-linked peptide retention time prediction using a simple amino acid composition encoding, yielding improved identification rates when the prediction error is included in rescoring. For the more challenging task of including fragment intensity prediction of cross-linked peptides in the rescoring, we obtain, on average, a similar improvement.

Here, a novel machine learning (ML) based method for predicting CCS integrating both molecular modeling (MM) and ML methodologies has been devised and shown to be able to accurately predict CCS values for singly charged small molecular weight molecules from a broad range of chemical classes. The model performed favorably compared to existing models, improving compound identifications for isobaric analytes in terms of ranking and assigning identification probability values to the annotation. Furthermore, charge localization was seen to be correlated with CCS prediction accuracy and with gas-phase proton affinity demonstrating the potential to provide a proxy for prediction error based on chemical structural properties.

We here present a thoroughly updated version of the MS\u00b2PIP web server, which includes new and more performant prediction models for both tryptic- and non-tryptic peptides, for immunopeptides, and for CID-fragmented TMT-labeled peptides. Additionally, we have also added new functionality to greatly facilitate the generation of proteome-wide predicted spectral libraries, requiring only a FASTA protein file as input. These libraries also include retention time predictions from DeepLC. Moreover, we now provide pre-built and ready-to-download spectral libraries for various model organisms in multiple DIA-compatible spectral library formats. Besides upgrading the back-end models, the user experience on the MS\u00b2PIP web server is thus also greatly enhanced, extending its applicability to new domains, including immunopeptidomics and MS3-based TMT quantification experiments.

{"title": "DeepLC can predict retention times for peptides that carry as-yet unseen modifications.", "abstract": "The inclusion of peptide retention time prediction promises to remove peptide identification ambiguity in complex liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identification workflows. However, due to the way peptides are encoded in current prediction models, accurate retention times cannot be predicted for modified peptides. This is especially problematic for fledgling open searches, which will benefit from accurate retention time prediction for modified peptides to reduce identification ambiguity. We present DeepLC, a deep learning peptide retention time predictor using peptide encoding based on atomic composition that allows the retention time of (previously unseen) modified peptides to be predicted accurately. We show that DeepLC performs similarly to current state-of-the-art approaches for unmodified peptides and, more importantly, accurately predicts retention times for modifications not seen during training.

{"title": "Morally admirable or moralistically deplorable? A theoretical framework for understanding character judgments of vegan advocates.", "abstract": "Over the last decade, vegan advocates have become a growing minority. By arguing against animal-product consumption and imposing the virtue-loaded call to \"go vegan,\" advocates have posed a direct challenge to the mainstream dietary ideology (termed \"carnism\") in hopes of positive social change. As a consequence, while vegan advocates may be admired for their morality and commitment, they may also be derogated with moralistic traits such as arrogance and overcommitment. We call this mixed-valence perception the \"vegan paradox\" and propose a theoretical framework for understanding it. Next, we develop a future research agenda to test and apply our framework, and inquire vegan advocacy for ethical, health, and environmental aims. Using the perspective of the idealistic vegan advocate as a reference point, we discuss the roles of the advocate's motives for change (i.e., the effectiveness of moral persuasion), the advocate's call for change (i.e., radical versus incremental change), the target's moral and carnist identification, and source attributes of the advocate. Lastly, we qualify our framework by highlighting further conceptual and methodological considerations.", "journal": "Appetite", "date": "2021-09-13", "authors": ["BenDe Groeve", "Daniel LRosenfeld"], "doi": "10.1016/j.appet.2021.105693"}
{"title": "Cov-MS: A Community-Based Template Assay for Mass-Spectrometry-Based Protein Detection in SARS-CoV-2 Patients.", "abstract": "Rising population density and global mobility are among the reasons why pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, spread so rapidly across the globe. The policy response to such pandemics will always have to include accurate monitoring of the spread, as this provides one of the few alternatives to total lockdown. However, COVID-19 diagnosis is currently performed almost exclusively by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Although this is efficient, automatable, and acceptably cheap, reliance on one type of technology comes with serious caveats, as illustrated by recurring reagent and test shortages. We therefore developed an alternative diagnostic test that detects proteolytically digested SARS-CoV-2 proteins using mass spectrometry (MS). We established the Cov-MS consortium, consisting of 15 academic laboratories and several industrial partners to increase applicability, accessibility, sensitivity, and robustness of this kind of SARS-CoV-2 detection. This, in turn, gave rise to the Cov-MS Digital Incubator that allows other laboratories to join the effort, navigate, and share their optimizations and translate the assay into their clinic. As this test relies on viral proteins instead of RNA, it provides an orthogonal and complementary approach to RT-PCR using other reagents that are relatively inexpensive and widely available, as well as orthogonally skilled personnel and different instruments.

Drawing on a recently demonstrated distinction between perceived morality and sociability in research on universal dimensions of stereotype content, we expected that veg*ns would be perceived as more moral but less sociable compared to omnivores. A lower perceived sociability would predict a lower social attractiveness of veg*ns, supported by two additional stereotypes theorized to be specifically associated with moral minorities: moralistic and eccentric impressions. In addition, we explored impressions toward people who consciously reduce their meat intake (i.e., flexitarians) and we complemented our quantitative analysis with an analysis of stereotype content omnivores freely associated with the dietary groups. Accordingly, using a single factor between-subjects experimental design, we randomly allocated a diverse sample of omnivores from the UK to answer questions about either omnivores (n\u00a0=\u00a0100), flexitarians (n\u00a0=\u00a0101), vegetarians (n\u00a0=\u00a0105) or vegans (n\u00a0=\u00a0106). Results largely confirmed our hypotheses: Although veg*ns were perceived as more moral, they were also stereotyped more negatively (especially vegans). More specifically, they were seen as more eccentric and, in particular, more moralistic, predicting a lower social attractiveness, though indirect effects via sociability were relatively small. Notably, flexitarians shared positive attributes of both non-flexitarian groups. Free association data were largely consistent with our results and provide additional direction for further inquiry.

However, different experimental setups (e.g., differences in columns, gradients, solvents, or stationary phase) have given rise to a multitude of prediction models that only predict accurate retention times for a specific experimental setup. In practice this typically results in the fitting of a new predictive model for each specific type of setup, which is not only inefficient but also requires substantial prior data to be accumulated on each such setup. Here we introduce the concept of generalized calibration, which is capable of the straightforward mapping of retention time models between different experimental setups. This concept builds on the database-controlled calibration approach implemented in PredRet and fits calibration curves on predicted retention times instead of only on observed retention times. We show that this approach results in substantially higher accuracy of elution-peak prediction than is achieved by setup-specific models.", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "date": "2020-04-14", "authors": ["RobbinBouwmeester", "LennartMartens", "SvenDegroeve"], "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.0c00233"}

These workflows are all challenging because of ambiguity in the identification stage; they either expand the search space and thus increase the ambiguity of identifications, or, in the case of DIA, they generate data that is inherently more ambiguous. In this context, machine learning-based predictive models are now generating considerable excitement in the field of proteomics because these predictive models hold great potential to drastically reduce the ambiguity in the identification process of the above-mentioned workflows. Indeed, the field has already produced classical machine learning and deep learning models to predict almost every aspect of a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) experiment. Yet despite all the excitement, thorough integration of predictive models in these challenging LC-MS workflows is still limited, and further improvements to the modeling and validation procedures can still be made.

{"title": "Okay to promote eating less meat, but don't be a cheat - The role of dietary identity, perceived inconsistency and inclusive language of an advocate in legitimizing meat reduction.", "abstract": "The legitimacy of meat-rich diets in Western societies is slowly in decline as the benefits of meat reduction for personal health, ecological welfare, and animal welfare are become increasingly clear. This is mirrored by a surge of campaigns, which rely heavily on social media platforms to legitimize meat reduction among their target audience: meat-eaters. Social Identity Theory suggests that the effectiveness of meat reduction advocacy will depend on the dietary identity of advocates and their rhetorical style. To examine this, we used a 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 between-participants factorial design in which we exposed meat-eaters (N\u202f=\u202f186) to a meat reduction campaign image shared by an advocate on Facebook, where the advocate was portrayed as either a meat-eater (ingroup) or a vegetarian (outgroup), who used either inclusive language (\"we can eat less meat\") or personal language (\"you can eat less meat\") to promote meat reduction. Results reveal that the meat-eating (versus vegetarian) advocate was more likely perceived as inconsistent when promoting meat reduction. Higher perceptions of inconsistency were significantly associated with a lower perceived legitimacy of the message for both advocate types, especially when the advocate was a vegetarian. We also found that meat-eaters were more tolerant of a perceived inconsistency when advocates used inclusive rather than personal language. Perceptions of favouritism towards the advocate could explain the conditional effects of perceived inconsistency on message legitimacy. Lastly, we could observe that meat-eaters who perceived the message as more legitimate and identified less as meat-eaters were more willing to eat less meat.

Therefore, we have evaluated the performance of seven machine learning algorithms on 36 distinct metabolomics data sets, using two distinct feature sets. Interestingly, the results show that no single learning algorithm performs optimally for all data sets, with different types of algorithms achieving top performance for different types of analytes or different protocols. Our results thus show that an evaluation of machine learning algorithms for retention time prediction is needed to find a suitable algorithm for specific analytes or protocols.

Despite limited genetic variability, members of the M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) have been shown to exhibit vast discrepancies in phenotypic presentation in terms of virulence, elicited immune response and transmissibility. Here, we used qualitative and quantitative mass spectrometry tools to investigate the proteomes of seven clinically-relevant mycobacterial strains-four M. tuberculosis strains, M. bovis, M. bovis BCG, and M. avium-that show varying degrees of pathogenicity and virulence, in an effort to rationalize the observed phenotypic differences. Following protein preparation, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) and data capture were carried out using an LTQ Orbitrap Velos. Data analysis was carried out using a novel bioinformatics strategy, which yielded high protein coverage and was based on high confidence peptides. Through this approach, we directly identified a total of 3788 unique M. tuberculosis proteins out of a theoretical proteome of 4023 proteins and identified an average of 3290 unique proteins for each of the MTBC organisms (representing 82% of the theoretical proteomes), as well as 4250 unique M. avium proteins (80% of the theoretical proteome). Data analysis showed that all major classes of proteins are represented in every strain, but that there are significant quantitative differences between strains. Targeted selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays were used to quantify the observed differential expression of a subset of 23 proteins identified by comparison to gene expression data as being of particular relevance to virulence. This analysis revealed differences in relative protein abundance between strains for proteins which may promote bacterial fitness in the more virulent W. Beijing strain. These differences may contribute to this strain's capacity for surviving within the host and resisting treatment, which has contributed to its rapid spread.

Few tools are however available to study the substrate specificity profiles of these enzymes. We developed a proteome-derived peptide library approach to study the substrate preferences of carboxypeptidases. Our COFRADIC-based approach takes advantage of the distinct chromatographic behavior of intact peptides and the proteolytic products generated by the action of carboxypeptidases, to enrich the latter and facilitate its MS-based identification. Two different peptide libraries, generated either by chymotrypsin or by metalloendopeptidase Lys-N, were used to determine the substrate preferences of human metallocarboxypeptidases A1 (hCPA1), A2 (hCPA2), and A4 (hCPA4). In addition, our approach allowed us to delineate the substrate specificity profile of mouse mast cell carboxypeptidase (MC-CPA or mCPA3), a carboxypeptidase suggested to function in innate immune responses regulation and mast cell granule homeostasis, but which thus far lacked a detailed analysis of its substrate preferences. mCPA3 was here shown to preferentially remove bulky aromatic amino acids, similar to hCPA2. This was also shown by a hierarchical cluster analysis, grouping hCPA1 close to hCPA4 in terms of its P1 primed substrate specificity, whereas hCPA2 and mCPA3 cluster separately. The specificity profile of mCPA3 may further aid to elucidate the function of this mast cell carboxypeptidase and its biological substrate repertoire. Finally, we used this approach to evaluate the substrate preferences of prolylcarboxypeptidase, a serine carboxypeptidase shown to cleave C-terminal amino acids linked to proline and alanine.", "journal": "Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP", "date": "2013-04-27", "authors": ["SebastianTanco", "JuliaLorenzo", "JavierGarcia-Pardo", "SvenDegroeve", "LennartMartens", "Francesc XavierAviles", "KrisGevaert", "PetraVan Damme"], "doi": "10.1074/mcp.M112.023234"}

One of these approaches is label-free MS2-based quantification, which takes advantage of the information computed from MS2 spectrum observations to estimate the abundance of a protein in a sample. As a first step in this approach, fragmentation spectra are typically matched to the peptides that generated them by a search algorithm. Because different search algorithms identify overlapping but non-identical sets of peptides, here we investigate whether these differences in peptide identification have an impact on the quantification of the proteins in the sample. We therefore evaluated the effect of using different search algorithms by examining the reproducibility of protein quantification in technical repeat measurements of the same sample. From our results, it is clear that a search engine effect does exist for MS2-based label-free protein quantification methods. As a general conclusion, it is recommended to address the overall possibility of search engine-induced bias in the protein quantification results of label-free MS2-based methods by performing the analysis with two or more distinct search engines.", "journal": "Omics : a journal of integrative biology", "date": "2012-07-19", "authors": ["SvenDegroeve", "AnStaes", "Pieter-JanDe Bock", "LennartMartens"], "doi": "10.1089/omi.2011.0137"}

Reuse of these publicly available data has so far been confined to rather specific, targeted reanalyses, but this limited reuse is set to expand dramatically as repositories continue to grow exponentially. Examples of large-scale reuse are readily found in other omics disciplines, where more comprehensive public data have already accumulated over longer periods.

{"title": "Analysis of the resolution limitations of peptide identification algorithms.", "abstract": "Proteome identification using peptide-centric proteomics techniques is a routinely used analysis technique. One of the most powerful and popular methods for the identification of peptides from MS/MS spectra is protein database matching using search engines. Significance thresholding through false discovery rate (FDR) estimation by target/decoy searches is used to ensure the retention of predominantly confident assignments of MS/MS spectra to peptides. However, shortcomings have become apparent when such decoy searches are used to estimate the FDR. To study these shortcomings, we here introduce a novel kind of decoy database that contains isobaric mutated versions of the peptides that were identified in the original search. Because of the supervised way in which the entrapment sequences are generated, we call this a directed decoy database. Since the peptides found in our directed decoy database are thus specifically designed to look quite similar to the forward identifications, the limitations of the existing search algorithms in making correct calls in such strongly confusing situations can be analyzed. Interestingly, for the vast majority of confidently identified peptide identifications, a directed decoy peptide-to-spectrum match can be found that has a better or equal match score than the forward match score, highlighting an important issue in the interpretation of peptide identifications in present-day high-throughput proteomics.", "journal": "Journal of proteome research", "date": "2011-10-15", "authors": ["NiklaasColaert", "SvenDegroeve", "KennyHelsens", "LennartMartens"], "doi": "10.1021/pr200913a"}

Precise translation initiation is of crucial importance, as truncated or extended proteins might fold, function, and locate erroneously. Still, as already shown for some proteins, alternative translation initiation can also serve as a regulatory mechanism. By applying N-terminal COFRADIC (combined fractional diagonal chromatography), we here isolated N-terminal peptides of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome and analyzed both annotated and alternative TIS. We analyzed this N-terminome of S. cerevisiae which resulted in the identification of 650 unique N-terminal peptides corresponding to database annotated TIS. Furthermore, 56 unique N(\u03b1)-acetylated peptides were identified that suggest alternative TIS (MS/MS-based), while MS-based evidence of N(\u03b1)-acetylation led to an additional 33 such peptides. To improve the overall sensitivity of the analysis, we also included the 5' UTR (untranslated region) in-frame translations together with the yeast protein sequences in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. To ensure the quality of the individual peptide identifications, peptide-to-spectrum matches were only accepted at a 99% probability threshold and were subsequently analyzed in detail by the Peptizer tool to automatically ascertain their compliance with several expert criteria. Furthermore, we have also identified 60 MS/MS-based and 117 MS-based N(\u03b1)-acetylated peptides that point to N(\u03b1)-acetylation as a post-translational modification since these peptides did not start nor were preceded (in their corresponding protein sequence) by a methionine residue. Next, we evaluated consensus sequence features of nucleic acids and amino acids across each of these groups of peptides and evaluated the results in the context of publicly available data. Taken together, we present a list of 706 annotated and alternative TIS for yeast proteins and found that under normal growth conditions alternative TIS might (co)occur in S. cerevisiae in roughly one tenth of all proteins. Furthermore, we found that the nucleic acid and amino acid features proximate to these alternative TIS favor either guanine or adenine nucleotides following the start codon or acidic amino acids following the initiator methionine. Finally, we also observed an unexpected high number of N(\u03b1)-acetylated peptides that could not be related to TIS and therefore suggest events of post-translational N(\u03b1)-acetylation.", "journal": "Journal of proteome research", "date": "2011-05-31", "authors": ["KennyHelsens", "PetraVan Damme", "SvenDegroeve", "LennartMartens", "ThomasArnesen", "Jo\u00eblVandekerckhove", "KrisGevaert"], "doi": "10.1021/pr2002325"}

Contemporary high-throughput peptide identification pipelines can quickly produce large quantities of MS/MS data that contain valuable knowledge about the actual physicochemical processes involved in the peptide fragmentation process, which can be extracted through extensive data mining studies. As these studies attempt to exploit the intensity information contained in the MS/MS spectra, a critical step required for a meaningful comparison of this information between MS/MS spectra is peak intensity normalization. We here describe a procedure for quantifying the efficiency of different published normalization methods in terms of the quartile coefficient of dispersion (qcod) statistic. The quartile coefficient of dispersion is applied to measure the dispersion of the peak intensities between redundant MS/MS spectra, allowing the quantification of the differences in computed peak intensity reproducibility between the different normalization methods.

The accurate prediction of intron boundaries largely facilitates the correct prediction of gene structure in nuclear genomes. Many tools for localizing these boundaries on DNA sequences have been developed and are available to researchers through the internet. Nevertheless, these tools still make many false positive predictions.\nThis manuscript presents a novel publicly available splice site prediction tool named SpliceMachine that (i) shows state-of-the-art prediction performance on Arabidopsis thaliana and human sequences, (ii) performs a computationally fast annotation and (iii) can be trained by the user on its own data.\nResults, figures and software are available at http://www.bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/supplementary_data/\nsven.degroeve@psb.ugent.be; yves.vandepeer@psb.ugent.be.", "journal": "Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)", "date": "2004-11-27", "authors": ["SvenDegroeve", "YvanSaeys", "BernardDe Baets", "PierreRouz\u00e9", "YvesVan de Peer"], "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/bti166"}
{"title": "Feature selection for splice site prediction: a new method using EDA-based feature ranking.", "abstract": "The identification of relevant biological features in large and complex datasets is an important step towards gaining insight in the processes underlying the data. Other advantages of feature selection include the ability of the classification system to attain good or even better solutions using a restricted subset of features, and a faster classification. Thus, robust methods for fast feature selection are of key importance in extracting knowledge from complex biological data.\nIn this paper we present a novel method for feature subset selection applied to splice site prediction, based on estimation of distribution algorithms, a more general framework of genetic algorithms. From the estimated distribution of the algorithm, a feature ranking is derived. Afterwards this ranking is used to iteratively discard features. We apply this technique to the problem of splice site prediction, and show how it can be used to gain insight into the underlying biological process of splicing.\nWe show that this technique proves to be more robust than the traditional use of estimation of distribution algorithms for feature selection: instead of returning a single best subset of features (as they normally do) this method provides a dynamical view of the feature selection process, like the traditional sequential wrapper methods. However, the method is faster than the traditional techniques, and scales better to datasets described by a large number of features.", "journal": "BMC bioinformatics", "date": "2004-05-25", "authors": ["YvanSaeys", "SvenDegroeve", "DirkAeyels", "PierreRouz\u00e9", "YvesVan de Peer"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-5-64\n10.1093/nar/gkf543\n10.1038/nrg890\n10.1101/gr.1679003\n10.1016/S0031-3203(99)00041-2\n10.1023/A:1012487302797\n10.1016/S0004-3702(97)00043-X\n10.1016/S0167-9236(02)00097-0\n10.1146/annurev.genet.36.043002.091635\n10.1016/S1360-1385(00)01595-8"}
{"title": "Fast feature selection using a simple estimation of distribution algorithm: a case study on splice site prediction.", "abstract": "Feature subset selection is an important preprocessing step for classification. In biology, where structures or processes are described by a large number of features, the elimination of irrelevant and redundant information in a reasonable amount of time has a number of advantages. It enables the classification system to achieve good or even better solutions with a restricted subset of features, allows for a faster classification, and it helps the human expert focus on a relevant subset of features, hence providing useful biological knowledge.\nWe present a heuristic method based on Estimation of Distribution Algorithms to select relevant subsets of features for splice site prediction in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that this method performs a fast detection of relevant feature subsets using the technique of constrained feature subsets. Compared to the traditional greedy methods the gain in speed can be up to one order of magnitude, with results being comparable or even better than the greedy methods. This makes it a very practical solution for classification tasks that can be solved using a relatively small amount of discriminative features (or feature dependencies), but where the initial set of potential discriminative features is rather large.", "journal": "Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)", "date": "2003-10-10", "authors": ["YvanSaeys", "SvenDegroeve", "DirkAeyels", "YvesVan De Peer", "PierreRouz\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1076"}
{"title": "Feature subset selection for splice site prediction.", "abstract": "The large amount of available annotated Arabidopsis thaliana sequences allows the induction of splice site prediction models with supervised learning algorithms (see Haussler (1998) for a review and references). These algorithms need information sources or features from which the models can be computed. For splice site prediction, the features we consider in this study are the presence or absence of certain nucleotides in close proximity to the splice site. Since it is not known how many and which nucleotides are relevant for splice site prediction, the set of features is chosen large enough such that the probability that all relevant information sources are in the set is very high. Using only those features that are relevant for constructing a splice site prediction system might improve the system and might also provide us with useful biological knowledge. Using fewer features will of course also improve the prediction speed of the system.\nA wrapper-based feature subset selection algorithm using a support vector machine or a naive Bayes prediction method was evaluated against the traditional method for selecting features relevant for splice site prediction. Our results show that this wrapper approach selects features that improve the performance against the use of all features and against the use of the features selected by the traditional method.\nThe data and additional interactive graphs on the selected feature subsets are available at http://www.psb.rug.ac.be/gps", "journal": "Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)", "date": "2002-10-19", "authors": ["SvenDegroeve", "BernardDe Baets", "YvesVan de Peer", "PierreRouz\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_2.s75"}
