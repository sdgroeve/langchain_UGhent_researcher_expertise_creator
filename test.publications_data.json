This emphasizes the need for software maintenance and continuous improvement for such algorithms. We introduce MS2Rescore 3.0, a versatile, modular, and user-friendly platform designed to increase peptide identifications. Researchers can install MS2Rescore across various platforms with minimal effort and benefit from a graphical user interface, a modular Python API, and extensive documentation. To showcase this new version, we connected MS2Rescore 3.0 with MS Amanda 3.0, a new release of the well-established search engine, addressing previous limitations on automatic rescoring. Among new features, MS Amanda now contains additional output columns that can be used for rescoring. The full potential of rescoring is best revealed when applied on challenging data sets. We therefore evaluated the performance of these two tools on publicly available single-cell data sets, where the number of PSMs was substantially increased, thereby demonstrating that MS2Rescore offers a powerful solution to boost peptide identifications. MS2Rescore's modular design and user-friendly interface make data-driven rescoring easily accessible, even for inexperienced users. We therefore expect the MS2Rescore to be a valuable tool for the wider proteomics community. MS2Rescore is available at https://github.com/compomics/ms2rescore.",

We brought together proteomics data generators, repository managers, and machine learning experts in a workshop with the goals to evaluate and explore machine learning applications for realistic modeling of data from multidimensional mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of any sample or organism. Following this sample-to-data roadmap helped identify knowledge gaps and define needs. Being able to generate bespoke and realistic synthetic data has legitimate and important uses in system suitability, method development, and algorithm benchmarking, while also posing critical ethical questions. The interdisciplinary nature of the workshop informed discussions of what is currently possible and future opportunities and challenges.

Since its inception, the MS²PIP peptide spectrum predictor has been widely used for various downstream applications, mostly thanks to its accuracy, ease-of-use, and broad applicability. We here present a thoroughly updated version of the MS²PIP web server, which includes new and more performant prediction models for both tryptic- and non-tryptic peptides, for immunopeptides, and for CID-fragmented TMT-labeled peptides. Additionally, we have also added new functionality to greatly facilitate the generation of proteome-wide predicted spectral libraries, requiring only a FASTA protein file as input. These libraries also include retention time predictions from DeepLC. Moreover, we now provide pre-built and ready-to-download spectral libraries for various model organisms in multiple DIA-compatible spectral library formats. Besides upgrading the back-end models, the user experience on the MS²PIP  web server is thus also greatly enhanced, extending its applicability to new domains, including immunopeptidomics and MS3-based TMT quantification experiments.

However, existing immunopeptidomics data analysis pipelines suffer from the nontryptic nature of immuno-peptides, complicating their identification. Previously, peak intensity predictions by (MSPIP)-P-2 and retention time predictions by DeepLC have been shown to improve tryptic peptide identifications when rescoring peptide-spectrum matches with Percolator. However, as (MSPIP)-P-2 was tailored toward tryptic peptides, we have here retrained (MSPIP)-P-2 to include nontryptic peptides. Interestingly, the new models not only greatly improve predictions for immunopeptides but also yield further improvements for tryptic peptides. We show that the integration of new (MSPIP)-P-2 models, DeepLC, and Percolator in one software package, MS(2)Rescore, increases spectrum identification rate and unique identified peptides with 46% and 36% compared to standard Percolator rescoring at 1% FDR. Moreover, MS(2)Rescore also outperforms the current state-of-the-art in immunopeptide-specific identification approaches. Altogether, MS2Rescore thus allows sub-stantially improved identification of novel epitopes from existing immunopeptidomics workflows.",

Here, we combine two RNA-centric methods ChIRP-MS and RNA-BioID to obtain a comprehensive list of proteins that interact with the well-known lncRNA HOTAIR.

The inclusion of peptide retention time prediction promises to remove peptide identification ambiguity in complex liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identification workflows. However, due to the way peptides are encoded in current prediction models, accurate retention times cannot be predicted for modified peptides. This is especially problematic for fledgling open searches, which will benefit from accurate retention time prediction for modified peptides to reduce identification ambiguity. We present DeepLC, a deep learning peptide retention time predictor using peptide encoding based on atomic composition that allows the retention time of (previously unseen) modified peptides to be predicted accurately. We show that DeepLC performs similarly to current state-of-the-art approaches for unmodified peptides and, more importantly, accurately predicts retention times for modifications not seen during training. Moreover, we show that DeepLC's ability to predict retention times for any modification enables potentially incorrect identifications to be flagged in an open search of a wide variety of proteome data.",

Screening human proteome fragments with a median size of 50-100 amino acids, we generate datasets that enable datamining into protein features underlying secretability, revealing a striking role for intrinsic disorder and chain flexibility. The SECRiFY methodology generates sufficient amounts of annotated data for advanced machine learning methods to deduce secretability patterns.

Both the resolution of shotgun proteomics methods and the search engines have improved dramatically, allowing for confident identification of SAAV peptides. However, it is not yet known if these methods are truly successful in accurately identifying SAAV peptides without prior genomic information in the search database. We studied this in unprecedented detail by exploiting publicly available long-read RNA sequences and shotgun proteomics data from the gold standard reference cell line NA12878. Searching spectra from this cell line with the state-of-the-art open modification search engine ionbot against carefully curated search databases resulted in 96.7% false-positive SAAVs and an 85% lower true positive rate than searching with peptide search databases that incorporate prior genetic information. While adding genetic variants to the search database remains indispensable for correct peptide identification, inclusion of long-read RNA sequences in the search database contributes only 0.3% new peptide identifications. These findings reveal the differences in SAAV detection that result from various approaches, providing guidance to researchers studying SAAV peptides and developers of peptide spectrum identification tools.",

To that end, features from the spectral intensity pattern predictors MS2PIP and Prosit were combined with the canonical scores from MaxQuant in the Percolator postprocessing tool for protein sequence databases constructed out of ribosome profiling and nanopore RNA-Seq analyses.

However, different experimental setups (e.g., differences in columns, gradients, solvents, or stationary phase) have given rise to a multitude of prediction models that only predict accurate retention times for a specific experimental setup. In practice this typically results in the fitting of a new predictive model for each specific type of setup, which is not only inefficient but also requires substantial prior data to be accumulated on each such setup. Here we introduce the concept of generalized calibration, which is capable of the straightforward mapping of retention time models between different experimental setups. This concept builds on the database-controlled calibration approach implemented in PredRet and fits calibration curves on predicted retention times instead of only on observed retention times. We show that this approach results in substantially higher accuracy of elution-peak prediction than is achieved by setup-specific models.",

These workflows are all challenging because of ambiguity in the identification stage; they either expand the search space and thus increase the ambiguity of identifications, or, in the case of DIA, they generate data that is inherently more ambiguous. In this context, machine learning-based predictive models are now generating considerable excitement in the field of proteomics because these predictive models hold great potential to drastically reduce the ambiguity in the identification process of the above-mentioned workflows. Indeed, the field has already produced classical machine learning and deep learning models to predict almost every aspect of a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) experiment. Yet despite all the excitement, thorough integration of predictive models in these challenging LC-MS workflows is still limited, and further improvements to the modeling and validation procedures can still be made.

Therefore, we have evaluated the performance of seven machine learning algorithms on 36 distinct metabolomics data sets, using two distinct feature sets. Interestingly, the results show that no single learning algorithm performs optimally for all data sets, with different types of algorithms achieving top performance for different types of analytes or different protocols. Our results thus show that an evaluation of machine learning algorithms for retention time prediction is needed to find a suitable algorithm for specific analytes or protocols.

Despite limited genetic variability, members of the M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) have been shown to exhibit vast discrepancies in phenotypic presentation in terms of virulence, elicited immune response and transmissibility. Here, we used qualitative and quantitative mass spectrometry tools to investigate the proteomes of seven clinically-relevant mycobacterial strains four M. tuberculosis strains, M. bovis, M. bovis BCG, and M. avium that show varying degrees of pathogenicity and virulence, in an effort to rationalize the observed phenotypic differences. Following protein preparation, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) and data capture were carried out using an LTQ Orbitrap Velos. Data analysis was carried out using a novel bioinformatics strategy, which yielded high protein coverage and was based on high confidence peptides. Through this approach, we directly identified a total of 3788 unique M. tuberculosis proteins out of a theoretical proteome of 4023 proteins and identified an average of 3290 unique proteins for each of the MTBC organisms (representing 82% of the theoretical proteomes), as well as 4250 unique M. avium proteins (80% of the theoretical proteome). Data analysis showed that all major classes of proteins are represented in every strain, but that there are significant quantitative differences between strains. Targeted selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays were used to quantify the observed differential expression of a subset of 23 proteins identified by comparison to gene expression data as being of particular relevance to virulence. This analysis revealed differences in relative protein abundance between strains for proteins which may promote bacterial fitness in the more virulent W. Beijing strain. These differences may contribute to this strain's capacity for surviving within the host and resisting treatment, which has contributed to its rapid spread. Through this approach, we have begun to describe the proteomic portrait of a successful mycobacterial pathogen. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXDO04165.",

However, the list of options to analyze this type of data is quite extensive, and the use of spectral libraries has become an important factor in DIA data analysis.

By working with a differential spike-in of human standard proteins (UPS2) in a constant yeast tryptic digest background, we evaluated the sensitivity, precision, and accuracy of the use of in silico predicted libraries in data DIA data analysis workflows compared to more established workflows. Three commonly used DIA software tools, DIA-NN, EncyclopeDIA, and Spectronaut, were each tested in spectral library mode and spectral library-free mode. In spectral library mode, we used independent spectral library prediction tools PROSIT and MS2PIP together with DeepLC, next to classical data-dependent acquisition (DDA)-based spectral libraries. In total, we benchmarked 12 computational workflows for DIA. Our comparison showed that DIA-NN reached the highest sensitivity while maintaining a good compromise on the reproducibility and accuracy levels in either library-free mode or using in silico predicted libraries pointing to a general benefit in using in silico predicted libraries.",

Researchers can install MS2Rescore across various platforms with minimal effort and benefit from a graphical user interface, a modular Python API, and extensive documentation. To showcase this new version, we connected MS2Rescore 3.0 with MS Amanda 3.0, a new release of the well-established search engine, addressing previous limitations on automatic rescoring. Among new features, MS Amanda now contains additional output columns that can be used for rescoring. The full potential of rescoring is best revealed when applied on challenging data sets. We therefore evaluated the performance of these two tools on publicly available single-cell data sets, where the number of PSMs was substantially increased, thereby demonstrating that MS2Rescore offers a powerful solution to boost peptide identifications. MS2Rescore's modular design and user-friendly interface make data-driven rescoring easily accessible, even for inexperienced users.

Subsequently, a one-vs-all classification and feature importance were used to analyze the most discriminating protein abundances per class. Based on protein abundance alone, the model was able to predict tissues with 98% accuracy, and cell types with 99% accuracy.

In-depth feature analysis shows slight confusion between physiologically similar tissues, demonstrating the capacity of the algorithm to detect biologically relevant patterns.

In this context, microbial biomass has emerged as a promising sustainable protein alternative. Nevertheless, often no consideration is given on the fact that the cultivation conditions affect the composition of microbial cells, and hence their quality and nutritional value. Apart from the properties and nutritional quality of the produced microbial food (ingredient), this can also impact its sustainability. To qualitatively assess these aspects, here, we investigated the link between substrate availability, growth rate, cell composition and size of Cupriavidus necator and Komagataella phaffii.ResultsBiomass with decreased nucleic acid and increased protein content was produced at low growth rates. Conversely, high rates resulted in larger cells, which could enable more efficient biomass harvesting. The proteome allocation varied across the different growth rates, with more ribosomal proteins at higher rates, which could potentially affect the techno-functional properties of the biomass. Considering the distinct amino acid profiles established for the different cellular components, variations in their abundance impacts the product quality leading to higher cysteine and phenylalanine content at low growth rates. Therefore, we hint that costly external amino acid supplementations that are often required to meet the nutritional needs could be avoided by carefully applying conditions that enable targeted growth rates.ConclusionIn summary, we demonstrate tradeoffs between nutritional quality and production rate, and we discuss the microbial biomass properties that vary according to the growth conditions.",

However, existing immunopeptidomics data analysis pipelines suffer from the nontryptic nature of immuno-peptides, complicating their identification. Previously, peak intensity predictions by (MSPIP)-P-2 and retention time predictions by DeepLC have been shown to improve tryptic peptide identifications when rescoring peptide-spectrum matches with Percolator. However, as (MSPIP)-P-2 was tailored toward tryptic peptides, we have here retrained (MSPIP)-P-2 to include nontryptic peptides. Interestingly, the new models not only greatly improve predictions for immunopeptides but also yield further improvements for tryptic peptides. We show that the integration of new (MSPIP)-P-2 models, DeepLC, and Percolator in one software package, MS(2)Rescore, increases spectrum identification rate and unique identified peptides with 46% and 36% compared to standard Percolator rescoring at 1% FDR.

In practice this typically results in the fitting of a new predictive model for each specific type of setup, which is not only inefficient but also requires substantial prior data to be accumulated on each such setup. Here we introduce the concept of generalized calibration, which is capable of the straightforward mapping of retention time models between different experimental setups. This concept builds on the database-controlled calibration approach implemented in PredRet and fits calibration curves on predicted retention times instead of only on observed retention times.

Indeed, the field has already produced classical machine learning and deep learning models to predict almost every aspect of a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) experiment.

The usage of such tools is however bound to the search engine's scoring scheme, which doesn't always make full use of the intensity information present in a spectrum. We aim to show how this tool can be applied in such a way that maximizes the use of spectrum intensity information by leveraging another machine learning-based tool, MS2PIP. MS2PIP predicts fragment ion peak intensities.\r\n\r\nResults: We show how comparing predicted intensities to annotated experimental spectra by calculating direct similarity metrics provides enough information for a tool such as Percolator to accurately separate two classes of peptide-to-spectrum matches. This approach allows using more information out of the data (compared with simpler intensity based metrics, like peak counting or explained intensities summing) while maintaining control of statistics such as the false discovery rate.",

            "abstract": "Liquid chromatography is a core component of almost all mass spectrometric analyses of (bio)molecules. Because of the high-throughput nature of mass spectrometric analyses, the interpretation of these chromatographic data increasingly relies on informatics solutions that attempt to predict an analyte's retention time. The key components of such predictive algorithms are the features these are supplies with, and the actual machine learning algorithm used to fit the model parameters. Therefore, we have evaluated the performance of seven machine learning algorithms on 36 distinct metabolomics data sets, using two distinct feature sets. Interestingly, the results show that no single learning algorithm performs optimally for all data sets, with different types of algorithms achieving top performance for different types of analytes or different protocols. Our results thus show that an evaluation of machine learning algorithms for retention time prediction is needed to find a suitable algorithm for specific analytes or protocols. Importantly, however, our results also show that blending different types of models together decreases the error on outliers, indicating that the combination of several approaches holds substantial promise for the development of more generic, high-performing algorithms.",

However, the list of options to analyze this type of data is quite extensive, and the use of spectral libraries has become an important factor in DIA data analysis. More specifically the use of in silico predicted libraries is gaining more interest. By working with a differential spike-in of human standard proteins (UPS2) in a constant yeast tryptic digest background, we evaluated the sensitivity, precision, and accuracy of the use of in silico predicted libraries in data DIA data analysis workflows compared to more established workflows. Three commonly used DIA software tools, DIA-NN, EncyclopeDIA, and Spectronaut, were each tested in spectral library mode and spectral library-free mode. In spectral library mode, we used independent spectral library prediction tools PROSIT and MS2PIP together with DeepLC, next to classical data-dependent acquisition (DDA)-based spectral libraries. In total, we benchmarked 12 computational workflows for DIA. Our comparison showed that DIA-NN reached the highest sensitivity while maintaining a good compromise on the reproducibility and accuracy levels in either library-free mode or using in silico predicted libraries pointing to a general benefit in using in silico predicted libraries.",

This emphasizes the need for software maintenance and continuous improvement for such algorithms. We introduce MS2Rescore 3.0, a versatile, modular, and user-friendly platform designed to increase peptide identifications. Researchers can install MS2Rescore across various platforms with minimal effort and benefit from a graphical user interface, a modular Python API, and extensive documentation. To showcase this new version, we connected MS2Rescore 3.0 with MS Amanda 3.0, a new release of the well-established search engine, addressing previous limitations on automatic rescoring. Among new features, MS Amanda now contains additional output columns that can be used for rescoring. The full potential of rescoring is best revealed when applied on challenging data sets. We therefore evaluated the performance of these two tools on publicly available single-cell data sets, where the number of PSMs was substantially increased, thereby demonstrating that MS2Rescore offers a powerful solution to boost peptide identifications. MS2Rescore's modular design and user-friendly interface make data-driven rescoring easily accessible, even for inexperienced users. We therefore expect the MS2Rescore to be a valuable tool for the wider proteomics community. MS2Rescore is available at https://github.com/compomics/ms2rescore.",

There are many different formats used for encoding spectral libraries, but none have undergone a standardization process to ensure broad applicability to many applications. As part of the Human Proteome Organization Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI), we have developed a standardized format for encoding spectral libraries, called mzSpecLib (https://psidev.info/mzSpecLib). It is primarily a data model that flexibly encodes metadata about the library entries using the extensible PSI-MS controlled vocabulary and can be encoded in and converted between different serialization formats. We have also developed a standardized data model and serialization for fragment ion peak annotations, called mzPAF (https://psidev.info/mzPAF). It is defined as a separate standard, since it may be used for other applications besides spectral libraries. The mzSpecLib and mzPAF standards are compatible with existing PSI standards such as ProForma 2.0 and the Universal Spectrum Identifier. The mzSpecLib and mzPAF standards have been primarily defined for peptides in proteomics applications with basic small molecule support. They could be extended in the future to other fields that need to encode spectral libraries for nonpeptidic analytes.",

Identifying HLAIps is challenging due to their high diversity, low abundance, and patient individuality. Here, we develop a highly sensitive method for identifying HLAIps using liquid chromatography-ion mobility-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-IMS-MS/MS). In addition, we train a timsTOF-specific peak intensity MS<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>PIP model for tryptic and non-tryptic peptides and implement it in MS<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>Rescore (v3) together with the CCS predictor from ionmob. The optimized method, Thunder-DDA-PASEF, semi-selectively fragments singly and multiply charged HLAIps based on their IMS and m/z. Moreover, the method employs the high sensitivity mode and extended IMS resolution with fewer MS/MS frames (300 ms TIMS ramp, 3 MS/MS frames), doubling the coverage of immunopeptidomics analyses, compared to the proteomics-tailored DDA-PASEF (100 ms TIMS ramp, 10 MS/MS frames). Additionally, rescoring boosts the HLAIps identification by 41.7% to 33%, resulting in 5738 HLAIps from as little as one million JY cell equivalents, and 14,516 HLAIps from 20 million. This enables in-depth profiling of HLAIps from diverse human cell lines and human plasma. Finally, profiling JY and Raji cells transfected to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein results in 16 spike HLAIps, thirteen of which have been reported to elicit immune responses in human patients.",

This community-driven resource makes it simple to access data in easy-to-process formats, and contains easy-to-follow tutorials that allow new users to interact with even the most advanced algorithms in the field. ProteomicsML provides data sets that are useful for comparing state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, as well as providing introductory material for teachers and newcomers to the field alike.

To this end, the target decoy approach (TDA) has become the cornerstone for extracting a set of reliable peptide-to-spectrum matches (PSMs) that will be used in downstream analysis. Indeed, TDA is now the default method to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) for a given set of PSMs, and users typically view it as a universal solution for assessing the FDR in the peptide identification step. However, the TDA also relies on a minimal set of assumptions, which are typically never verified in practice. We argue that a violation of these assumptions can lead to poor FDR control, which can be detrimental to any downstream data analysis.

In this context, microbial biomass has emerged as a promising sustainable protein alternative. Nevertheless, often no consideration is given on the fact that the cultivation conditions affect the composition of microbial cells, and hence their quality and nutritional value. Apart from the properties and nutritional quality of the produced microbial food (ingredient), this can also impact its sustainability. To qualitatively assess these aspects, here, we investigated the link between substrate availability, growth rate, cell composition and size of Cupriavidus necator and Komagataella phaffii.ResultsBiomass with decreased nucleic acid and increased protein content was produced at low growth rates. Conversely, high rates resulted in larger cells, which could enable more efficient biomass harvesting. The proteome allocation varied across the different growth rates, with more ribosomal proteins at higher rates, which could potentially affect the techno-functional properties of the biomass. Considering the distinct amino acid profiles established for the different cellular components, variations in their abundance impacts the product quality leading to higher cysteine and phenylalanine content at low growth rates. Therefore, we hint that costly external amino acid supplementations that are often required to meet the nutritional needs could be avoided by carefully applying conditions that enable targeted growth rates.ConclusionIn summary, we demonstrate tradeoffs between nutritional quality and production rate, and we discuss the microbial biomass properties that vary according to the growth conditions.",

Despite a high mortality rate and increasing antibiotic resistance no clinically approved vaccine against Listeria is available. Attenuated Listeria strains offer protection and are tested as antitumor vaccine vectors, but would benefit from a better knowledge on immunodominant vector antigens. To identify novel antigens, we screen for Listeria peptides presented on the surface of infected human cell lines by mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics. In between more than 15,000 human self-peptides, we detect 68 Listeria immunopeptides from 42 different bacterial proteins, including several known antigens.

Encoding these highly presented antigens in lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccine formulations results in specific CD8(+) T-cell responses and induces protection in vaccination challenge experiments in mice. Our results can serve as a starting point for the development of a clinical mRNA vaccine against Listeria and aid to improve attenuated Listeria vaccines and vectors, demonstrating the power of immunopeptidomics for next-generation bacterial vaccine development.\n\nCurrently, no approved vaccines for Listeria monocytogenes are available.

However, existing immunopeptidomics data analysis pipelines suffer from the nontryptic nature of immuno-peptides, complicating their identification. Previously, peak intensity predictions by (MSPIP)-P-2 and retention time predictions by DeepLC have been shown to improve tryptic peptide identifications when rescoring peptide-spectrum matches with Percolator. However, as (MSPIP)-P-2 was tailored toward tryptic peptides, we have here retrained (MSPIP)-P-2 to include nontryptic peptides. Interestingly, the new models not only greatly improve predictions for immunopeptides but also yield further improvements for tryptic peptides. We show that the integration of new (MSPIP)-P-2 models, DeepLC, and Percolator in one software package, MS(2)Rescore, increases spectrum identification rate and unique identified peptides with 46% and 36% compared to standard Percolator rescoring at 1% FDR.

The Human Proteome Organization Proteomics Standards Initiative in collaboration with several members of the Consortium for Top-Down Proteomics (CTDP) has developed a standard notation called ProForma 2.0, which is a substantial extension of the original ProForma notation developed by the CTDP. ProForma 2.0 aims to unify the representation of proteoforms and peptidoforms. ProForma 2.0 supports use cases needed for bottom-up and middle-/top-down proteomics approaches and allows the encoding of highly modified proteins and peptides using a human- and machine-readable string. ProForma 2.0 can be used to represent protein modifications in a specified or ambiguous location, designated by mass shifts, chemical formulas, or controlled vocabulary terms, including cross-links (natural and chemical) and atomic isotopes. Notational conventions are based on public controlled vocabularies and ontologies.

Next to the classical bioactive peptides, emerging from larger precursor proteins by specific proteolytic processing, a new class of peptides originating from small open reading frames (sORFs) have been recognized as important biological regulators. But their intrinsic properties, specific expression pattern and location on presumed non-coding regions have hindered the full characterization of the repertoire of bioactive peptides, despite their predominant role in various pathways. Although the development of peptidomics has offered the opportunity to study these peptides in vivo, it remains challenging to identify the full peptidome as the lack of cleavage enzyme specification and large search space complicates conventional database search approaches. In this study, we introduce a proteogenomics methodology using a new type of mass spectrometry instrument and the implementation of machine learning tools toward improved identification of potential bioactive peptides in the mouse brain. The application of trapped ion mobility spectrometry (tims) coupled to a time-of-flight mass analyzer (TOF) offers improved sensitivity, an enhanced peptide coverage, reduction in chemical noise and the reduced occurrence of chimeric spectra. Subsequent machine learning tools (MSPIP)-P-2, predicting fragment ion intensities and DeepLC, predicting retention times, improve the database searching based on a large and comprehensive custom database containing both sORFs and alternative ORFs. Finally, the identification of peptides is further enhanced by applying the post-processing semi-supervised learning tool Percolator. Applying this workflow, the first peptidomics workflow combined with spectral intensity and retention time predictions, we identified a total of 167 predicted sORF-encoded peptides, of which 48 originating from presumed non-coding locations, next to 401 peptides from known neuropeptide precursors, linked to 66 annotated bioactive neuropeptides from within 22 different families. Additional PEAKS analysis expanded the pool of SEPs on presumed non-coding locations to 84, while an additional 204 peptides completed the list of peptides from neuropeptide precursors. Altogether, this study provides insights into a new robust pipeline that fuses technological advancements from different fields ensuring an improved coverage of the neuropeptidome in the mouse brain.",

Both the resolution of shotgun proteomics methods and the search engines have improved dramatically, allowing for confident identification of SAAV peptides. However, it is not yet known if these methods are truly successful in accurately identifying SAAV peptides without prior genomic information in the search database. We studied this in unprecedented detail by exploiting publicly available long-read RNA sequences and shotgun proteomics data from the gold standard reference cell line NA12878. Searching spectra from this cell line with the state-of-the-art open modification search engine ionbot against carefully curated search databases resulted in 96.7% false-positive SAAVs and an 85% lower true positive rate than searching with peptide search databases that incorporate prior genetic information. While adding genetic variants to the search database remains indispensable for correct peptide identification, inclusion of long-read RNA sequences in the search database contributes only 0.3% new peptide identifications. These findings reveal the differences in SAAV detection that result from various approaches, providing guidance to researchers studying SAAV peptides and developers of peptide spectrum identification tools.",

In this context, machine learning-based predictive models are now generating considerable excitement in the field of proteomics because these predictive models hold great potential to drastically reduce the ambiguity in the identification process of the above-mentioned workflows. Indeed, the field has already produced classical machine learning and deep learning models to predict almost every aspect of a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) experiment. Yet despite all the excitement, thorough integration of predictive models in these challenging LC-MS workflows is still limited, and further improvements to the modeling and validation procedures can still be made.

            "abstract": "The overall well-being of organisms is widely recognized to be closely intertwined with their intestinal health. The intestinal mucosal layer plays a pivotal role in ensuring the proper functioning of the intestine, a fact observed not only in humans but also in animals like pigs. Any alterations to the mucosal layer of a pig's intestine can potentially disrupt its functionality, thereby impacting the animal's health and productivity. Mass spectrometry-based proteome analysis serves as a valuable tool in investigating the intricate dynamics of the proteome within the intestinal mucosa. Such studies hold promise in uncovering causal relationships between mucosal changes and overall health outcomes in pigs. It is anticipated that insights gathered from proteome studies will inform future strategies aimed at enhancing the health and productivity of pigs. However, the research field lacks a standardized and detailed method to extract proteins from pig intestinal mucosa and prepare proteins for proteome analysis. In the present study, we evaluated three alternative S-Trap-based protocols for analyzing ileal mucosal scrapings from pigs. Samples were either freeze-dried and treated as solid samples or ground in liquid nitrogen, categorized as either solid or liquid samples. In our analysis, a total of 2840 proteins were identified across all samples. Through statistical analysis and gene ontology examinations, we investigated potential differences between the three approaches. Even though our findings revealed no significant differences among the three methods, we propose the use of the protocol wherein samples are freeze-dried and treated as solid for protein extraction. This protocol stands out as the most convenient and practical option, offering ease of use and ensuring consistent and reliable results. By establishing a standardized approach, we aim to advance research efforts in understanding pig intestinal health. Significance: The development of an optimized protocol for protein extraction of intestinal mucosal scrapings in pigs addresses a gap in the field and enhances future research on pig intestinal health. By use of the protocol and mass spectrometry-based proteome analysis, valuable insights for improving the health and productivity of pigs can be presented. Studying the complex dynamics of the proteome within the intestinal mucosa, potentially identifying links between mucosal changes and health outcomes, provides us with information about the critical connection between intestinal health and the overall well-being and productivity of pigs. By creating a standardized approach, consistent, reliable, and reproducible results can be obtained for this type of research.",

            "abstract": "To survive extreme desiccation, seeds enter a period of quiescence that can last millennia. Seed quiescence involves the accumulation of protective storage proteins and lipids through unknown adjustments in protein homeostasis (proteostasis). Here, we show that mutation of all six type-II metacaspase (MCA-II) proteases in Arabidopsis thaliana disturbs proteostasis in seeds. MCA-II mutant seeds fail to restrict the AAA ATPase CELL DIVISION CYCLE 48 (CDC48) at the endoplasmic reticulum to discard misfolded proteins, compromising seed storability. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization of CDC48 relies on the MCA-IIs-dependent cleavage of PUX10 (ubiquitination regulatory X domain-containing 10), the adaptor protein responsible for titrating CDC48 to lipid droplets. PUX10 cleavage enables the shuttling of CDC48 between lipid droplets and the ER, providing an important regulatory mechanism sustaining spatiotemporal proteolysis, lipid droplet dynamics, and protein homeostasis. In turn, the removal of the PUX10 adaptor in MCA-II mutant seeds partially restores proteostasis, CDC48 localization, and lipid droplet dynamics prolonging seed lifespan. Taken together, we uncover a proteolytic module conferring seed longevity.\n\nHere, the authors have generated a metacapase type II depletion model providing evidence for their paramount role in seed longevity. They also show that this is accomplished by regulating the ERAD, the proteostatic pathway crucial for seeds.",

            "abstract": "Exogenous glucocorticoids are frequently used to treat inflammatory disorders and as adjuncts for the treatment of solid cancers. However, their use is associated with severe side effects and therapy resistance. Novel glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligands with a patient-validated reduced side effect profile have not yet reached the clinic. GR is a member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors and heavily relies on interactions with coregulator proteins for its transcriptional activity. To elucidate the role of the GR interactome in the differential transcriptional activity of GR following treatment with the selective GR agonist and modulator dagrocorat compared to classic (ant)agonists, we generated comprehensive interactome maps by high-confidence proximity proteomics in lung epithelial carcinoma cells. We found that dagrocorat and the antagonist RU486 both reduced GR interaction with CREB-binding protein/p300 and the mediator complex compared to the full GR agonist dexamethasone. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that these changes in GR interactome were accompanied by reduced GR chromatin occupancy with dagrocorat and RU486. Our data offer new insights into the role of differential coregulator recruitment in shaping ligand-specific GR-mediated transcriptional responses.",

To help the plant research community interpret the ever-increasing number of reported PTMs, The Plant PTM Viewer (https://www.psb.ugent.be/PlantPTMViewer) provides an intuitive overview and tools to assess plant protein PTMs. This update includes 62 novel PTM profiling studies, adding a total of 112,000 modified peptides reporting plant PTMs, including 14 additional PTM types and three species (moss, tomato and soybean). Furthermore, an open modification re-analysis of a large-scale Arabidopsis thaliana mass spectrometry tissue atlas identified previously uncharted landscapes of lysine acylations predominant in seed and flower tissues and 3-phosphoglycerylation on glycolytic enzymes in plants. An extra ‘protein list analysis’ tool was developed for retrieval and assessing the enrichment of PTMs a protein list of interest. We conducted a protein list analysis on nuclear proteins, revealing a substantial number of redox modifications in the nucleus, confirming previous assumptions regarding the redox regulation of transcription. We encourage the plant research community to use PTM Viewer 2.0 for hypothesis testing and new target discovery and also to submit new data to expand the coverage of conditions, plant species, and PTM types, thereby enriching our understanding of plant biology.

            "abstract": "Background European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) trees produce seeds irregularly; therefore, it is necessary to store beech seeds for forestation. Despite the acquisition of desiccation tolerance during development, beech seeds are classified as intermediate because they lose viability during long-term storage faster than typical orthodox seeds. In this study, beech seeds stored for short (3 years) or long (20 years) periods under optimal conditions and displaying 92 and 30% germination capacity, respectively, were compared. Results Aged seeds displayed increased membrane damage, manifested as electrolyte leakage and lipid peroxidation levels. Analyses have been based on embryonic axes, which contained higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and higher levels of protein-bound methionine sulfoxide (MetO) in aged seeds. Using label-free quantitative proteomics, 3,949 proteins were identified, of which 2,442 were reliably quantified pointing to 24 more abundant proteins and 35 less abundant proteins in beech seeds under long-term storage conditions. Functional analyses based on gene ontology annotations revealed that nucleic acid binding activity (molecular function), ribosome organization or biogenesis and transmembrane transport (cellular processes), translational proteins (protein class) and membranous anatomical entities (cellular compartment) were affected in aged seeds. To verify whether MetO, the oxidative posttranslational modification of proteins that can be reversed via the action of methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) enzymes, is involved in the aging of beech seeds, we identified and quantified 226 MetO-containing proteins, among which 9 and 19 exhibited significantly up- and downregulated MetO levels, respectively, in beech seeds under long-term storage conditions. Several Msr isoforms were identified and recognized as MsrA1-like, MsrA4, MsrB5 and MsrB5-like in beech seeds. Only MsrA1-like displayed decreased abundance in aged seeds. Conclusions We demonstrated that the loss of membrane integrity reflected in the elevated abundance of membrane proteins had a higher impact on seed aging progress than the MetO/Msr system. Proteome analyses enabled us to propose protein Sec61 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as potential longevity modulators in beech seeds.",

In recent years, the specificities and substrates of the enzymes responsible for this modification, the N alpha-terminal acetyltransferases, have been mapped in several proteomic studies. Aberrant expression of, and mutations in these enzymes were found to be associated with several human diseases, explaining the growing interest in protein N alpha-terminal acetylation. With some enzymes, such as the N alpha-terminal acetyltransferase A complex having thousands of possible substrates, researchers are now trying to decipher the functional outcome of N alpha-terminal protein acetylation. In this review, we zoom in on one possible functional consequence of N alpha-terminal protein acetylation; its effect on protein folding. Using selected examples of proteins associated with human diseases such as alpha-synuclein and huntingtin, here, we discuss the sometimes contradictory findings of the effects of N alpha-terminal protein acetylation on protein (mis)folding and aggregation.\n\nThis review explores the eukaryotic N alpha-terminal acetyltransferases (NAT), a family of key enzymes that co-translationally modify protein N-termini. Aberrant expression and mutant NAT variants are implicated in various human diseases such as cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders and a family of rare developmental syndromes.

Drug discovery methods to reduce animal models in oncology may include three-dimensional (3D) cellular systems that take into account tumor microenvironment (TME) cell types and biomechanical properties.\n\nMethods\nIn this study we reconstructed a 3D tumor using an elastic polymer (acrylate-endcapped urethane-based poly(ethylene glycol) (AUPPEG)) with clinical relevant stiffness. Single cell suspensions from low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC) patient-derived early passage cultures of cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) embedded in a collagen gel were introduced to the AUPPEG scaffold.

Here, by means of various proteomics approaches, we generated the overall interactome of the five AP and the TPLATE complexes in Arabidopsis thaliana. The interactome converged on a number of hub proteins, including the thus far unknown adaptin binding-like protein, designated P34. P34 interacted with the clathrin-associated AP complexes, controlled their stability and, subsequently, influenced clathrin-mediated endocytosis and various post-Golgi trafficking routes.

Here, we established a protocol for the antibody-dependent detection of TGM1 protein and the parallel detection of TGM activity. TGM1 immunoreactivity initially increased and co-localized with membrane-associated TGM activity during keratinocyte differentiation. TGM activity persisted upon further differentiation of keratinocytes, whereas TGM1 immunoreactivity was lost under standard assay conditions. Pretreatment of tissue sections with the proteases trypsin or proteinase K enabled immunodetection of TGM1 in cornified keratinocytes, indicating that removal of other proteins was a prerequisite for TGM1 immunolabeling after cornification. The increase of TGM activity and subsequent loss of TGM1 immunoreactivity could be replicated in HEK293T cells transfected with TGM1, suggesting that protein cross-linking mediated by TGM1 itself may lead to reduced recognition of TGM1 by antibodies. To screen for proteins potentially regulating TGM1, we performed Virotrap experiments and identified the CAPNS1 subunit of calpain as an interaction partner of TGM1. Treatment of keratinocytes and TGM1-transfected HEK293T cells with chemical inhibitors of calpain suppressed transglutamination. Our findings suggest that calpain contributes to the control of TGM1-mediated transglutamination and proteins cross-linked by transglutamination mask epitopes of TGM1.",

CysQuant involves light/heavy iodoacetamide isotopologues for differential labeling of reduced and reversibly oxidized cysteines analyzed by data-dependent acquisition (DDA) or data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS). Using plexDIA with in silico predicted spectral libraries, we quantified an average of 18% cysteine oxidation in Arabidopsis thaliana by DIA-MS, including a subset of highly oxidized cysteines forming disulfide bridges in AlphaFold2 predicted structures. Applying CysQuant to Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to excessive light, we successfully quantified the well-established increased reduction of Calvin-Benson cycle enzymes and discovered yet uncharacterized redox-sensitive disulfides in chloroplastic enzymes.

The bulk of protein N-terminal acetylation in S. cerevisiae is catalyzed by the N-terminal acetyltransferases NatA, NatB, and NatC. Thus far, proteome-wide identification of the in vivo protein substrates of yeast NatA and NatB has been performed by N-terminomics. Here, we used S. cerevisiae deleted for the NatC catalytic subunit Naa30 and identified 57 yeast NatC substrates by N-terminal combined fractional diagonal chromatography analysis. Interestingly, in addition to the canonical N-termini starting with ML, MI, MF, and MW, yeast NatC substrates also included MY, MK, MM, MA, MV, and MS. However, for some of these substrate types, such as MY, MK, MV, and MS, we also uncovered (residual) non-NatC NAT activity, most likely due to the previously established redundancy between yeast NatC and NatE/Naa50. Thus, we have revealed a complex interplay between different NATs in targeting methionine-starting N-termini in yeast. Furthermore, our results showed that ectopic expression of human NAA30 rescued known NatC phenotypes in naa30Δ yeast, as well as partially restored the yeast NatC Nt-acetylome. Thus, we demonstrate an evolutionary conservation of NatC from yeast to human thereby underpinning future disease models to study pathogenic NAA30 variants. Overall, this work offers increased biochemical and functional insights into NatC-mediated N-terminal acetylation and provides a basis for future work to pinpoint the specific molecular mechanisms that link the lack of NatC-mediated N-terminal acetylation to phenotypes of NatC deletion yeast.",

Methods: Human monocyte-derived macrophages were exposed to 2 Gy/ fraction/ day for 5 days, mimicking one week of cancer patient’s radiotherapy. Protein expression profile by proteomics was performed. Results: A gene ontology analysis revealed that radiation-induced protein changes are associated with metabolic alterations, which were further supported by a reduction of both cellular ATP levels and glucose uptake. Most of the radiation-induced deregulated targets exhibited a decreased expression, as was the case of cathepsin D, a lysosomal protease associated with cell death, which was validated by Western blot. We also found that irradiated macrophages exhibited an increased expression of the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is responsible for the uptake of transferrin-bound iron. TfR1 upregulation was also found in tumor-associated mouse macrophages upon tumor irradiation. In vitro irradiated macrophages also presented a trend for increased divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), which transports iron from the endosome to the cytosol, and a significant increase in iron release.

MS has become a method of choice for allergen analysis, even if quantification remains challenging. Moreover, harmonization is still lacking between laboratories, while interlaboratory validation of analytical methods is necessary for such harmonization. Objective This interlaboratory study aimed to evaluate the potential of MS for food allergen detection and quantification using a standard addition quantification strategy and a stable isotope-labeled (SIL) concatemer as an internal standard. Methods In-house-produced test material (cookies), blank and incurred with four allergens (egg, milk, peanut, and hazelnut), allergen standards, an internal standard, and the complete methodology (including sample preparation and ultra-HPLC-MS/MS method) were provided to nine laboratories involved in the study. Method sensitivity and selectivity were evaluated with incurred test material and accuracy with spiked test material. Quantification was based on the standard addition strategy using certified reference materials as allergen protein standards and a SIL concatemer as an internal standard. Results All laboratories were able to detect milk, hazelnut, and peanut in the incurred cookies with sufficient sensitivity to reach the AOAC INTERNATIONAL Standard Method Performance Requirements (SMPR (R) 2016.002). Egg detection was more complicated due to food processing effects, yet five laboratories reached the sensitivity requirements. Recovery results were laboratory-dependent. Some milk and hazelnut peptides were quantified in agreement with SMPR 2016.002 by all participants. Furthermore, over 90% of the received quantification results agreed with SMPR 2016.002 for method precision.

Splicing of precursor-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) is catalyzed by a dynamic ribonucleoprotein complex, designated the spliceosome. In a suppressor screen, we identified a nonsense mutation in the Smith (Sm) antigen protein SME1 to alleviate photorespiratory H2O2-dependent cell death in catalase deficient plants. Similar attenuation of cell death was observed upon chemical inhibition of the spliceosome, suggesting pre-mRNA splicing inhibition to be responsible for the observed cell death alleviation. Furthermore, the sme1-2 mutants showed increased tolerance to the reactive oxygen species inducing herbicide methyl viologen. Both an mRNA-seq and shotgun proteomic analysis in sme1-2 mutants displayed a constitutive molecular stress response, together with extensive alterations in pre-mRNA splicing of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes and RNA binding proteins, even under unstressed conditions. Using SME1 as a bait to identify protein interactors, we provide experimental evidence for almost 50 homologs of the mammalian spliceosome-associated protein to reside in the Arabidopsis thaliana spliceosome complexes and propose roles in pre-mRNA splicing for four uncharacterized plant proteins. Furthermore, as for sme1-2, a mutant in the Sm core assembly protein ICLN resulted in a decreased sensitivity to methyl viologen. Taken together, these data show that both a perturbed Sm core composition and assembly results in the activation of a defense response and in enhanced resilience to oxidative stress.",

            "abstract": "Most eukaryotic proteins are N-terminally acetylated, but the functional impact on a global scale has remained obscure. Using genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens in human cells, we reveal a strong genetic dependency between a major N-terminal acetyltransferase and specific ubiquitin ligases. Biochemical analyses uncover that both the ubiquitin ligase complex UBR4-KCMF1 and the acetyltransferase NatC recognize proteins bearing an unacetylated N-terminal methionine followed by a hydrophobic residue. NatC KO-induced protein degradation and phenotypes are reversed by UBR knockdown, demonstrating the central cellular role of this interplay. We reveal that loss of Drosophila NatC is associated with male sterility, reduced longevity, and age-dependent loss of motility due to developmental muscle defects. Remarkably, muscle-specific overexpression of UbcE2M, one of the proteins targeted for NatC KO-mediated degradation, suppresses defects of NatC deletion. In conclusion, NatC-mediated N-terminal acetylation acts as a protective mechanism against protein degradation, which is relevant for increased longevity and motility.\n\nThe most common protein modification in eukaryotes is N-terminal acetylation, but its functional impact has remained enigmatic. Here, the authors find that a key role for N-terminal acetylation is shielding proteins from ubiquitin ligase-mediated degradation, mediating motility and longevity.",

Such proteoforms can have altered localizations, stabilities, and functions. Although proteoforms generated from splice variants can be engaged in different protein complexes, it remained to be studied to what extent this applies to N-terminal proteoforms. To address this, we mapped the interactomes of several pairs of N-terminal proteoforms and their canonical counterparts. First, we generated a catalogue of N-terminal proteoforms found in the HEK293T cellular cytosol from which 22 pairs were selected for interactome profiling. In addition, we provide evidence for the expression of several N-terminal proteoforms, identified in our catalogue, across different human tissues, as well as tissue-specific expression, highlighting their biological relevance. Protein–protein interaction profiling revealed that the overlap of the interactomes for both proteoforms is generally high, showing their functional relation. We also showed that N-terminal proteoforms can be engaged in new interactions and/or lose several interactions compared with their canonical counterparts, thus further expanding the functional diversity of proteomes.",

Binding of HS ligands is determined by the sulfation code on the HS chain that can be N-/2-O/6-O- or 3-O-sulfated, generating heterogenous sulfation patterns. 3-O sulfated HS (3S-HS) play a role in several (patho)physiological processes such as blood coagulation, viral pathogenesis and binding and internalization of tau in Alzheimer's disease. However, few 3S-HS-specific interactors are known. Thus, our insight into the role of 3S-HS in health and disease is limited, especially in the central nervous system. Using human CSF, we determined the interactome of synthetic HS with defined sulfation patterns. Our affinity-enrichment mass spectrometry studies expand the repertoire of proteins that may interact with (3S-)HS. Validating our approach, ATIII, a known 3S-HS interactor, was found to require GlcA-GlcNS6S3S for binding, similar to what has been reported. Our dataset holds novel, potential HS and 3S-HS protein ligands, that can be explored in future studies focusing on molecular mechanisms that depend on 3S-HS in (patho)physiological conditions.",

Here, we describe that induction of a heat shock-related stress response mediated by Foldlin, a small-molecule tool compound, reduces the protein levels of misfolded/aggregated mutant p53, while contact mutants or wild-type p53 remain largely unaffected. Foldlin also prevented the formation of stress-induced p53 nuclear inclusion bodies. Despite our inability to identify a specific molecular target, Foldlin also reduced protein levels of aggregating SOD1 variants. Finally, by screening a library of 778 FDA-approved compounds for their ability to reduce misfolded mutant p53, we identified the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib with similar cellular effects as Foldlin. Overall, the induction of a cellular heat shock response seems to be an effective strategy to deal with pathological protein aggregation.

Data-independent acquisition (DIA)-based proteomics was found to outperform data-dependent acquisition (DDA) workflows, especially in identifying the downregulated bacterial proteome response during infection progression by permitting quantification of low abundant bacterial proteins at early times of infection when bacterial infection load is low. S.

Whereas the residence of the pathogen inside the host can impact the functioning of the latter drastically, the bacterial macromolecular content is typically vastly outstripped by that of the host. This sizeable difference in macromolecular content has thus far hindered proteome profiling of bacteria and its infected host in an integrated and unbiased manner.

As the structure-function relation-ship of metacaspases remains poorly understood, we solved the X-ray crystal structure of an Arabidopsis thaliana type II metacaspase (AtMCA-IIf) belonging to a particular subgroup not requiring calcium ions for activation. To study metacaspase activity in plants, we developed an in vitro chemical screen to identify small molecule metacaspase inhibitors and found several hits with a minimal thioxodihydropyrimidine-dione structure, of which some are specific AtMCA-IIf inhibitors. We provide mechanistic insight into the basis of inhibition by the TDP-containing compounds through molecular docking onto the AtMCA-IIf crystal structure. Finally, a TDP-containing compound (TDP6) effectively hampered lateral root emergence in vivo, probably through inhibition of metacaspases specifically expressed in the endodermal cells overlying developing lateral root primordia. In the future, the small compound inhibitors and crystal structure of AtMCA-IIf can be used to study metacaspases in other species, such as important human pathogens, including those causing neglected diseases.",

In insects, alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase (FucT6) is an important enzyme in the glycosylation pathway, modifying the core structure of N-glycans on glycoproteins with the addition of a fucose residue. In our previous study, RNAi-mediated silencing of FucT6 in the third-instar nymphs of Nilaparvata lugens caused a failure of the ecdysis process during nymphal development, leading to high mortality. These results suggested the requirement of FucT6 during nymphal development in N. lugens. In this study, RNAi-mediated gene silencing of FucT6 in adults did not cause lethality. However, parental RNAi of FucT6 led to full failure in the hatching of eggs, and this effect was maternally mediated. Interestingly, gene expression levels of FucT6 in the eggs peaked at the kata-trepsis event, where the embryo rotates 180 degrees resulting in the head pointing towards the anterior side of the egg. Proteome analysis showed significant differences in the abundance of proteins between different embryonal developmental stages, suggesting the crucial role of FucT6 mediated core N-fucosylation in embryonal devel-opment. Therefore, correct alpha-1,6-fucosylation of glycoproteins is important for N. lugens during embryonic development and this study provides new insights into the role of N-glycosylation in embryogenesis in insects.",

The effort to fight this disease is hampered by a lack of disease-modifying treatments and the absence of an early, accurate diagnostic tool. Neuropathology begins years or decades before symptoms occur and, upon onset of symptoms, diagnosis can take a year or more. Such delays postpone treatment and make research into the early stages of the disease difficult. Ideally, clinicians require a minimally invasive test that can detect AD in its early stages, before cognitive symptoms occur. Advances in proteomic technologies have facilitated the study of promising biomarkers of AD. Over the last two years (2019-2021) studies have identified and validated many species which can be measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, or in both fluids, and which have a high predictive value for AD. We herein discuss proteins which have been highlighted as promising biomarkers of AD in the last two years, and consider implications for future research within the research framework of the amyloid (A), tau (T), neurodegeneration (N) scoring system. We review recently identified species of amyloid and tau which may improve diagnosis when used in combination with current measures such as amyloid-beta-42 (A beta 42), total tau (t tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). In addition, several proteins have been identified as likely proxies for neurodegeneration, including neurofilament light (NfL), synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) and neurogranin (NRGN). Finally, proteins originating from diverse processes such as neuroinflammation, lipid transport and mitochondrial dysfunction could aid in both AD diagnosis and patient stratification.",

Pathological variants in the SLC33A1 gene coding for AT-1 have been linked to a disorder called Huppke-Brendel syndrome, which is characterized by congenital cataracts, hearing loss, severe developmental delay and early death. It has been described in eight patients so far, who all had the abovementioned symptoms together with low serum copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations. The link between AT-1 and low ceruloplasmin concentrations is not clear, nor is the complex pathogenesis of the disease. Here we describe a further case of Huppke-Brendel syndrome with a novel and truncating homozygous gene variant and provide novel biochemical data on N-acetylated amino acids in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. Our results indicate that decreased levels of many N-acetylated amino acids in CSF are a typical metabolic fingerprint for AT-1 deficiency and are potential biomarkers for the defect. As acetyl-CoA is an important substrate for protein acetylation, we performed N-terminal proteomics, but found only minor effects on this particular protein modification. The acetyl-CoA content in patient's fibroblasts was insignificantly decreased. Our data may help to better understand the mechanisms underlying the metabolic disturbances, the pathophysiology and the clinical phenotype of the disease.",

At present, knowledge of immunomodulatory effects of plant lectins in insects is scarce. Treatment of insect cells with the Orysa sativa lectin, Orysata, was previously reported to induce cell aggregation, mimicking the immune process of encapsulation. In this project we investigated the potential immunomodulatory effects of this mannose-binding lectin using Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. Identification of the Orysata binding partners on the surface of S2 cells through a pull-down assay and proteomic analysis revealed 221 putative interactors, several of which were immunity-related proteins. Subsequent qPCR analysis revealed the upregulation of Toll- and immune deficiency (IMD)-regulated antimicrobial peptides (Drs, Mtk, AttA, and Dpt) and signal transducers (Rel and Hid) belonging to the IMD pathway. In addition, the iron-binding protein Transferrin 3 was identified as a putative interactor for Orysata, and treatment of S2 cells with Orysata was shown to reduce the intracellular iron concentration. All together, we believe these results offer a new perspective on the effects by which plant lectins influence insect cells and contribute to the study of their immunomodulatory properties.",

Unfortunately, their use is hampered by many side effects and therapy resistance. Efforts to find more selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonists and modulators (called SEGRAMs) that are able to separate anti-inflammatory effects via gene repression from metabolic effects via gene activation, have been unsuccessful so far. In this study, we characterized a set of functionally diverse GR ligands in A549 cells, first using a panel of luciferase-based reporter gene assays evaluating GR-driven gene activation and gene repression. We expanded this minimal assay set with novel luciferase-based read-outs monitoring GR protein levels, GR dimerization and GR Serine 211 (Ser211) phosphorylation status and compared their outcomes with compound effects on the mRNA levels of known GR target genes in A549 cells and primary hepatocytes. We found that luciferase reporters evaluating GR-driven gene activation and gene repression were not always reliable predictors for effects on endogenous target genes. Remarkably, our novel assay monitoring GR Ser211 phosphorylation levels proved to be the most reliable predictor for compound effects on almost all tested endogenous GR targets, both driven by gene activation and repression. The integration of this novel assay in existing screening platforms running both in academia and industry may therefore boost chances to find novel GR ligands with an actual improved therapeutic benefit.",

            "abstract": "Background: In addition to its role in the digestive system, the peritrophic membrane (PM) provides a physical barrier protecting the intestine from abrasion and against pathogens. Because of its sensitivity to RNA interference (RNAi), the notorious pest insect, the Colorado potato beetle (CPB, Leptinotarsa decemlineata), has become a model insect for functional studies. Previously, RNAi-mediated silencing of Mannosidase-Ia (ManIa), a key enzyme in the transition from high-mannose glycan moieties to paucimannose N-glycans, was shown to disrupt the transition from larva to pupa and the metamorphosis into adult beetles. While these effects at the organismal level were interesting in a pest control context, the effects at the organ or tissue level and also immune effects have not been investigated yet. To fill this knowledge gap, we performed an analysis of the midgut and PM in ManIa-silenced insects.\n\nResults: As marked phenotype, the ManIa(RNAi) insects, the PM pore size was found to be decreased when compared to the control GFP(RNAi) insects. These smaller pores are related to the observation of thinner microvilli (Mv) on the epithelial cells of the midgut of ManIa(RNAi) insects. A midgut and PM proteome study and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis with a selection of marker genes was performed to characterize the midgut cells and understand their response to the silencing of ManIa. In agreement with the loss of ManIa activity, an accumulation of high-mannose N-glycans was observed in the ManIa-silenced insects. As a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), the presence of these glycan structures could trigger the activation of the immune pathways.\n\nConclusion: The observed decrease in PM pore size could be a response to prevent potential pathogens to access the midgut epithelium. This hypothesis is supported by the strong increase in transcription levels of the anti-fungal peptide drosomycin-like in ManIa(RNAi) insects, although further research is required to elucidate this possibility. The potential immune response in the midgut and the smaller pore size in the PM shed a light on the function of the PM as a physical barrier and provide evidence for the relation between the Mv and PM.

Two samba genome edited mutants showed growth defects, such as reduced internode length, shortened upper leaves with erect leaf architecture, and reduced leaf size due to an altered cell division rate and cell expansion, which aggravated with plant age. The two mutants differed in the severity and developmental onset of the phenotypes, because samba-1 represented a knockout allele, while translation re-initiation in samba-3 resulted in a truncated protein that was still able to interact with the APC/C and regulate its function, albeit with altered APC/C activity and efficiency. Our data are consistent with a dosage-dependent role for SAMBA to control developmental processes for which a change in growth rate is pivotal.",

            "abstract": "Background Cow's milk allergy is one of the most reported food allergies in Europe. To help patients suffering from food allergies it is important to be able to detect milk in different foods. An analytical method that is gaining interest in the field of allergen detection is ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, where the analyte is a target peptide. When these peptide biomarkers are selected, the effect of food processing should be taken into account to allow a robust detection method. Objective This work aims at identifying such processing stable peptide markers for milk for the ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry based detection of food allergens in different food products. Method Milk-incurred food materials that underwent several processing techniques were produced. This was followed by establishing tryptic peptide profiles from each matrix using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. Results A careful comparison of peptide profiles/intensities and the use of specific exclusion criteria resulted in the selection of eight peptide biomarkers suitable for application in ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry based milk detection methods. One of these markers is an alpha-lactalbumin specific peptide, which has been determined to be stable in different incurred materials for the first time. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first systematic and experimentally based approach for the selection of suitable milk peptide biomarkers robust toward multiple, often applied food processing techniques for milk. Ensuring the exact knowledge of the food processing circumstances by starting from well-defined raw material and using fully controlled settings to produce incurred test material allowed the construction of a peptide database with robust markers. These robust markers can be used for the development of a robust detection method for milk in different food matrixes.",

Actin dynamics is regulated through a myriad of actin-binding proteins and post-translational modifications. The mammalian actin family consists of six different isoforms, which vary slightly in their N terminal (Nt) sequences. During and after synthesis, actins undergo an intricate Nt-processing that yields mature actin isoforms. The ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic (3-actin is Nt-acetylated by N-alpha acetyltransferase 80 (NAA80) yielding the Nt-sequence Ac-DDDI-. In addition, (3-actin was also reported to be Nt-arginylated by arginyltransferase 1 (ATE1) after further peptidase-mediated processing, yielding RDDI-. To characterize in detail the Nt-processing of actin, we used state-of-the-art proteomics. To estimate the relative cellular levels of Nt-modified proteoforms of actin, we employed NAA80-lacking cells, in which actin was not Nt-acetylated. We found that targeted proteomics is superior to a commercially available antibody previously used to analyze Nt-arginylation of (3-actin. Significantly, despite the use of sensitive mass spectrometry-based techniques, we could not confirm the existence of the previously claimed Nt-arginylated (3-actin (RDDI-) in either wildtype or NAA80-lacking cells. A very minor level of Ntarginylation of the initially cleaved (3-actin (DDDI-) could be identified, but only in NAA80-lacking cells, not in wildtype cells. We also identified small fractions of cleaved and unmodified (3-actin (DDI-) as well as cleaved and Nt-acetylated (3-actin (Ac-DDI-). In sum, we show that the multi-step Nt-maturation of (3-actin is terminated by NAA80, which Nt-acetylates the exposed Nt-Asp residues, in the virtual absence of previously claimed Nt-arginylation.",

Treatment with rac-GR24 modifies the root architecture at different levels, such as decreasing the lateral root density (LRD), while promoting root hair elongation or flavonol accumulation. Previously, we have shown that the flavonol biosynthesis is transcriptionally activated in the root by rac-GR24 treatment, but, thus far, the molecular players involved in that response have remained unknown. To get an in-depth insight into the changes that occur after the compound is perceived by the roots, we compared the root transcriptomes of the wild type and the more axillary growth2 (max2) mutant, affected in both SL and karrikin signaling pathways, with and without rac-GR24 treatment. Quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR, reporter line analysis and mutant phenotyping indicated that the flavonol response and the root hair elongation are controlled by the ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) and MYB12 transcription factors, but HY5, in contrast to MYB12, affects the LRD as well. Furthermore, we identified the transcription factors TARGET OF MONOPTEROS 5 (TMO5) and TMO5 LIKE1 as negative and the Mediator complex as positive regulators of the rac-GR24 effect on LRD. Altogether, hereby, we get closer toward understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlay the rac-GR24 responses in the root.",

However, we here demonstrate that TAD reagents are actually not selective for tyrosine and that tryptophan residues are in fact also labelled with these reagents. This off-target labelling remained under the radar as it is challenging to detect these physiologically stable but thermally labile modifications with the commonly used HCD and CID MS/MS techniques. We show that selectivity of tryptophan over tyrosine can be achieved by lowering the pH of the aqueous buffer to effect selective Trp-labelling. Given the low relative abundance of tryptophan compared to tyrosine in natural proteins, this results in a new site-selective bioconjugation method that does not rely on enzymes nor unnatural amino acids and is demonstrated for peptides and recombinant proteins.",

For its germination, it has to perceive various structurally diverging host-exuded signals, including isothiocyanates (ITCs) and strigolactones (SLs). However, the receptors involved are still uncharacterized. Here, we identified five putative SL receptors in P. ramosa, of which PrKAI2d3 is involved in seed germination stimulation. We established the high plasticity of PrKAI2d3, allowing interaction with different chemicals, including ITCs. The SL perception mechanism of PrKAI2d3 is similar to that of endogenous SLs in non-parasitic plants. We provide evidence that the PrKAI2d3 enzymatic activity confers hypersensitivity to SLs. Additionally, we demonstrated that methylbutenolide-OH binds PrKAI2d3 and stimulates P. ramosa germination with a bioactivity comparable to that of ITCs. This study highlights that P. ramosa has extended its signal perception system during evolution, a fact to be considered in the development of specific and efficient biocontrol methods.",

Despite their high degree of homology the three AKT isoforms (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3) are non-redundant and can even have opposing functions. Small-molecule AKT inhibitors affect all three isoforms which severely limits their usefulness as research tool or therapeutic. Using AKT2-specific nanobodies we examined the function of endogenous AKT2 in breast cancer cells. Two AKT2 nanobodies (Nb8 and Nb9) modulate AKT2 and reduce MDA-MB-231 cell viability/proliferation. Nb8 binds the AKT2 hydrophobic motif and reduces IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of this site. This nanobody also affects the phosphorylation and/or expression levels of a wide range of proteins downstream of AKT, resulting in a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, the induction of autophagy, a reduction in focal adhesion count and loss of stress fibers. While cell cycle progression is likely to be regulated by more than one isoform, our results indicate that both the effects on autophagy and the cytoskeleton are specific to AKT2. By using an isoform-specific nanobody we were able to map a part of the AKT2 pathway. Our results confirm AKT2 and the hydrophobic motif as targets for cancer therapy. Nb8 can be used as a research tool to study AKT2 signalling events and aid in the design of an AKT2-specific inhibitor.",

We previously reported that the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interface, formed by the choroid plexus epithelial (CPE) cells, releases an increased amount of EVs into the CSF in response to peripheral inflammation. Here, we studied the importance of CP-mediated EV release in AD pathogenesis. We observed increased EV levels in the CSF of young transgenic APP/PS1 mice which correlated with high amyloid beta (A beta) CSF levels at this age. The intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of A beta oligomers (A beta O) in wild-type mice revealed a significant increase of EVs in the CSF, signifying that the presence of CSF-A beta O is sufficient to induce increased EV secretion. Using in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo approaches, we identified the CP as a major source of the CSF-EVs. Interestingly, A beta O-induced, CP-derived EVs induced pro-inflammatory effects in mixed cortical cultures. Proteome analysis of these EVs revealed the presence of several pro-inflammatory proteins, including the complement protein C3. Strikingly, inhibition of EV production using GW4869 resulted in protection against acute A beta O-induced cognitive decline. Further research into the underlying mechanisms of this EV secretion might open up novel therapeutic strategies to impact the pathogenesis and progression of AD.",

The mechanism by which NAA15 haploinsufficiency causes congenital heart disease (CHD) remains unknown. To better understand molecular processes by which NAA15 haploinsufficiency perturbs cardiac development, we introduced NAA15 variants into human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and assessed the consequences of these mutations on RNA and protein expression.\r\n\r\nObjective: We aim to understand the role of NAA15 haploinsufficiency in cardiac development by investigating proteomic effects on NatA complex activity, and identifying proteins dependent upon a full amount of NAA15.\r\n\r\nMethods and Results: We introduced heterozygous LoF, compound heterozygous and missense residues (R276W) in iPS cells using CRISPR/Cas9. Haploinsufficient NAA15 iPS cells differentiate into cardiomyocytes, unlike NAA15-null iPS cells, presumably due to altered composition of NatA. Mass spectrometry (MS) analyses reveal ~80% of identified iPS cell NatA targeted proteins displayed partial or complete Nt-acetylation. Between null and haploinsufficient NAA15 cells Nt-acetylation levels of 32 and 9 NatA-specific targeted proteins were reduced, respectively. Similar acetylation loss in few proteins occurred in NAA15 R276W iPSCs. In addition, steady-state protein levels of 562 proteins were altered in both null and haploinsufficient NAA15 cells; eighteen were ribosomal-associated proteins. At least four proteins were encoded by genes known to cause autosomal dominant CHD.\r\n\r\nConclusions: These studies define a set of human proteins that requires a full NAA15 complement for normal synthesis and development. A 50% reduction in the amount of NAA15 alters levels of at least 562 proteins and Nt-acetylation of only 9 proteins. One or more modulated proteins are likely responsible for NAA15-haploinsufficiency mediated CHD. Additionally, genetically engineered iPS cells provide a platform for evaluating the consequences of amino acid sequence variants of unknown significance on NAA15 function.",

This process is mediated by the interaction of the carbohydrate-binding domain with sugar structures on the cell surface, and this binding can be inhibited by pre-incubation of the lectin with its specific sugars. However, when incubated with insect cells, Orysata, a mannose-binding lectin from rice, caused aggregation of the cells, independent from carbohydrate binding activity. This phenomenon was observed for multiple insect cell lines, confirming the robustness of this phenotype. While the carbohydrate-dependent agglutination of red blood cells happens within minutes, the carbohydrate-independent aggregation of insect cells requires longer incubation times. Further analysis with the galactose-binding lectins SSA and Jacalin, validated the robustness of this lectin-induced, carbohydrate-independent aggregation in different insect cell lines. Since proteomic analysis revealed no changes in the proteome after treatment with the lectins, this cell aggregation is likely caused by the (in) activation or re-organization of the existing surface proteins. The use of inhibitors of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, staurosporine (STS) and a phosphatase inhibitor (PPI) cocktail, pointed to dephosphorylation as a key mechanism in the lectin-induced, carbohydrate-independent aggregation of insect cells. Similar to contact inhibition, cell proliferation in cell aggregates was decreased. Analysis of the marker for cell proliferation, cyclin E, confirmed that aggregated cells enter a quiescent state. The current data offer a new perspective on the mechanism by which lectins execute their activities, specifically through lectin-induced phosphatase-mediated cell aggregation and proliferation inhibition, independent from their carbohydrate-binding activity.",

The two groups of molecules are involved in overlapping and unique developmental processes, and signal-specific outcomes are attributed to perception by the paralogous α/β-hydrolases DWARF14 (D14) for SL and KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE 2/HYPOSENSITIVE TO LIGHT (KAI2/HTL) for KAR/KL. In addition, depending on which receptor is activated, specific members of the SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1 (SMAX1)-LIKE (SMXL) family control KAR/KL and SL responses. As proteins that function in the same signal transduction pathway often occur in large protein complexes, we aimed at discovering new players of the MAX2, D14, and KAI2 protein network by tandem affinity purification in Arabidopsis cell cultures. When using MAX2 as a bait, various proteins were copurified, among which were general components of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box complex and members of the CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 9 signalosome. Here, we report the identification of a novel interactor of MAX2, a type 5 serine/threonine protein phosphatase, designated PHYTOCHROME-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 5 (PAPP5). Quantitative affinity purification pointed at PAPP5 as being more present in KAI2 rather than in D14 protein complexes. In agreement, mutant analysis suggests that PAPP5 modulates KAR/KL-dependent seed germination under suboptimal conditions and seedling development. In addition, a phosphopeptide enrichment experiment revealed that PAPP5 might dephosphorylate MAX2 in vivo independently of the synthetic SL analog, rac-GR24. Together, by analyzing the protein complexes to which MAX2, D14, and KAI2 belong, we revealed a new MAX2 interactor, PAPP5, that might act through dephosphorylation of MAX2 to control mainly KAR/KL-related phenotypes and, hence, provide another link with the light pathway.",

Catalyzed by components of bacteriophage-encoded homologous recombination systems and only requiring short ~40 to 50 base homologies, the targeted and precise introduction of modifications (e.g., deletions, knockouts, insertions and point mutations) into the chromosome and other episomal replicons is empowered. Furthermore, by its ability to make use of both double- and single-stranded linear DNA editing substrates (e.g., PCR products or oligonucleotides, respectively), lengthy subcloning of specific DNA sequences is circumvented. Further, the more recent implementation of CRISPR-associated endonucleases has allowed for more efficient screening of successful recombinants by the selective purging of non-edited cells, as well as the creation of markerless and scarless mutants. In this review we discuss various recombineering strategies to promote different types of gene modifications, how they are best applied, and their possible pitfalls.",

            "abstract": "Alterations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels have a profound impact on numerous signaling cascades orchestrating plant growth, development, and stress signaling, including programmed cell death. To expand the repertoire of known molecular mechanisms implicated in H2O2 signaling, we performed a forward chemical screen to identify small molecules that could alleviate the photorespiratory-induced cell death phenotype of Arabidopsisthaliana mutants lacking H2O2-scavenging capacity by peroxisomal catalase2. Here, we report the characterization of pakerine, an m-sulfamoyl benzamide from the sulfonamide family. Pakerine alleviates the cell death phenotype of cat2 mutants exposed to photorespiration-promoting conditions and delays dark-induced senescence in wild-type Arabidopsis leaves. By using a combination of transcriptomics, metabolomics, and affinity purification, we identified abnormal inflorescence meristem 1 (AIM1) as a putative protein target of pakerine. AIM1 is a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase involved in fatty acid β-oxidation that contributes to jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis. Whereas intact JA biosynthesis was not required for pakerine bioactivity, our results point toward a role for β-oxidation-dependent SA production in the execution of H2O2-mediated cell death.",

We propose the use of concatemer, an artificial and stable isotope-labelled protein composed of several concatenated signature peptides as internal standard. With a comparative analysis of three matrices contaminated with four allergens (egg, milk, peanut, and hazelnut), the concatemer approach was found to offer advantages associated with the use of labelled proteins, ideal but unaffordable, and circumvent certain limitations of traditionally used synthetic peptides as internal standards.

This is of particular interest, as the level of H2O2 in Arabidopsis plants increases during osmotic stress, which can be counteracted by overexpression of ERD14. \r\nMethods: The proteomic mass-spectrometry analysis of stressed plants was performed to find the candidates affected by ERD14. With cross-linking, microscale thermophoresis, and active-site titration kinetics, the interaction and influence of ERD14 on the function of two target proteins: glutathione transferase Phi9 and catalase was examined. \r\nResults: Under osmotic stress, redox enzymes, specifically the glutathione transferase Phi enzymes, are upregulated. Using microscale thermophoresis, we showed that ERD14 directly interacts with GSTF9 with a K-D of similar to 25 mu M. ERD14 activates the inactive GSTF9 molecules, protects GSTF9 from oxidation, and can also increases the activity of the enzyme. Aside from GSTF9, we found that ERD14 can also interact with catalase, an important cellular H2O2 scavenging enzyme, with a K-D of similar to 0.13 mu M, and protects it from dehydration-induced loss of activity. \r\nConclusions: We propose that fully intrinsically disordered dehydrin ERD14 might protect and even activate redox enzymes, helping plants to survive oxidative stress under dehydration conditions. \r\nGeneral significance: ERD14 has a direct effect on the activity of redox enzymes.",

As a central node in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which regulates various processes considered to be hallmarks of cancer, this kinase has become a prime target for cancer therapy. However, AKT has proven to be a highly complex target as it comes in three isoforms (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3) which are highly homologous, yet non-redundant. The isoform-specific functions of the AKT kinases can be dependent on context (i.e. different types of cancer) and even opposed to one another. To date, there is no isoform-specific inhibitor available and no alternative to genetic approaches to study the function of a single AKT isoform. We have developed and characterized nanobodies that specifically interact with the AKT1 or AKT2 isoforms. These new tools should enable future studies of AKT1 and AKT2 isoform-specific functions. Furthermore, for both isoforms we obtained a nanobody that interferes with the AKT-PIP3-interaction, an essential step in the activation of the kinase. The nanobodies characterized in this study are a new stepping stone towards unravelling AKT isoform-specific signalling.",

Unfortunately, their use is associated with debilitating side effects, including hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, mood swings, and weight gain. Despite the continued efforts of pharma as well as academia, the search for so-called selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators (SEGRMs), compounds with strong anti-inflammatory or anti-cancer properties but a reduced number or level of side effects, has had limited success so far. Although monoclonal antibody therapies have been successfully introduced for the treatment of certain disorders (such as anti-TNF for rheumatoid arthritis), glucocorticoids remain the first-in-line option for many other chronic diseases including asthma, multiple sclerosis, and multiple myeloma. This perspective offers our opinion on why a continued search for SEGRMs remains highly relevant in an era where small molecules are sometimes unrightfully considered old-fashioned. Besides a discussion on which bottlenecks and pitfalls might have been overlooked in the past, we elaborate on potential solutions and recent developments that may push future research in the right direction.",

A prime example is the transcript isoform switch that leads to the read-through expression of the long non-coding RNA NEAT1_2, at the expense of the shorter polyadenylated transcript NEAT1_1. NEAT1_2 is required for assembly of paraspeckles (PS), nuclear bodies that protect cancer cells from oncogene-induced replication stress and chemotherapy. Searching for proteins that modulate this event, we identified factors involved in the 3' end processing of polyadenylated RNA and components of the Integrator complex. Perturbation experiments established that, by promoting the cleavage of NEAT1_2, Integrator forces NEAT1_2 to NEAT1_1 isoform switching and, thereby, restrains PS assembly. Consistently, low levels of Integrator subunits correlated with poorer prognosis of cancer patients exposed to chemotherapeutics. Our study establishes that Integrator regulates PS biogenesis and a link between Integrator, cancer biology, and chemosensitivity, which may be exploited therapeutically.",

Differences in protein glycosylation between sexes have already been observed in humans, nematodes and trematodes, and have recently also been reported in the rice pest insect Nilaparvata lugens. Although protein N-glycosylation in insects is nowadays of high interest because of its potential for exploitation in pest control strategies, the functionality of differential N-glycosylation between sexes is yet unknown. In this study, therefore, the occurrence and role of sex-related protein N-glycosylation in insects were examined. A comprehensive investigation of the N-glycosylation sites from the adult stages of N. lugens was conducted, allowing a qualitative and quantitative comparison between sexes at the glycopeptide level. N-glycopeptide enrichment via lectin capturing using the high mannose/paucimannose-binding lectin Concanavalin A, or the Rhizoctonia solani agglutinin which interacts with complex N-glycans, resulted in the identification of over 1300 N-glycosylation sites derived from over 600 glycoproteins. Comparison of these N-glycopeptides revealed striking differences in protein N-glycosylation between sexes. Male- and female-specific N-glycosylation sites were identified, and some of these sex-specific N-glycosylation sites were shown to be derived from proteins with a putative role in insect reproduction. In addition, differential glycan composition between males and females was observed for proteins shared across sexes. Both lectin blotting experiments as well as transcript expression analyses with complete insects and insect tissues confirmed the observed differences in N-glycosylation of proteins between sexes. In conclusion, this study provides further evidence for protein N-glycosylation to be sex-related in insects. Furthermore, original data on N-glycosylation sites of N. lugens adults are presented, providing novel insights into planthopper's biology and information for future biological pest control strategies.",

Its general workflow consists of three main steps: sample preparation, liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and computational data analysis. Quality assessment of the different steps and components of this workflow is instrumental to identify technical flaws and avoid loss of precious measurement time and sample material. However, assessment of the extent of sample losses along with the sample preparation protocol, in particular, after proteolytic digestion, is not yet routinely implemented because of the lack of an accurate and straightforward method to quantify peptides. Here, we report on the use of a microfluidic UV/visible spectrophotometer to quantify MS-ready peptides directly in the MS-loading solvent, consuming only 2 mu L of sample. We compared the performance of the microfluidic spectrophotometer with a standard device and determined the optimal sample amount for LC-MS/MS analysis on a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer using a dilution series of a commercial K562 cell digest. A careful evaluation of selected LC and MS parameters allowed us to define 3 mu g as an optimal peptide amount to be injected into this particular LC-MS/MS system. Finally, using tryptic digests from human HEK293T cells and showing that injecting equal peptide amounts, rather than approximate ones, result in less variable LC-MS/MS and protein quantification data. The obtained quality improvement together with easy implementation of the approach makes it possible to routinely quantify MS-ready peptides as a next step in daily proteomics quality control.",

ABA-independent SnRK2s act at the post-transcriptional level via phosphorylation of VARICOSE (VCS), a member of the mRNA decapping complex, that catalyzes the first step of 5'mRNA decay.

All three protein kinases phosphorylated Ser645 and Ser1156 of VCS, while SnRK2.6 and SnRK2.10 also phosphorylated VCS Ser692 and Ser680 of VCR.

Overexpression of UBP12 or UBP13 strongly decreased leaf size and cell area, and resulted in lower ploidy levels. Mutants in which UBP12 and UBP13 were downregulated produced smaller leaves that contained fewer and smaller cells.

Commonly used free-space based SERS substrates, however, require the use of bulky and expensive instrumentation, limiting their use to laboratory environments. An integrated photonics approach aims to implement various free-space optical components to a reliable, mass-reproducible and cheap photonic chip. We here demonstrate integrated SERS detection of trypsin activity using a nanoplasmonic slot waveguide as a waveguide-based SERS substrate. Despite the continuously improving SERS performance of the waveguide-based SERS substrates, they currently still do not reach the SERS enhancements of free-space substrates. To mitigate this, we developed an improved peptide substrate in which we incorporated the non-natural aromatic amino acid 4-cyano-phenylalanine, which provides a high intrinsic SERS signal. The use of non-natural aromatics is expected to extend the possibilities for multiplexing measurements, where the activity of several proteases can be detected simultaneously.",

            "abstract": "The CRISPR/Cas9 revolution is profoundly changing the way life sciences technologies are used. Many assays now rely on engineered clonal cell lines to eliminate the overexpression of bait proteins. Control cell lines are typically nonengineered cells or engineered clones, implying a considerable risk for artifacts because of clonal variation. Genome engineering can also transform BioID, a proximity labeling method that relies on fusing a bait protein to a promiscuous biotin ligase, BirA*, resulting in the tagging of vicinal proteins. We here propose an innovative design to enable BioID for endogenous proteins wherein we introduce a T2A-BirA* module at the C-terminus of endogenous p53 by genome engineering, leading to bicistronic expression of both p53 and BirA* under control of the endogenous promoter. By targeting a Cas9-cytidine deaminase base editor to the T2A autocleavage site, we can efficiently derive an isogenic population expressing a functional p53-BirA* fusion protein. Using quantitative proteomics we show significant benefits over the classical ectopic expression of p53-BirA*, and we provide a first well-controlled view of the proximal proteins of endogenous p513 in colon carcinoma cells. This novel application for base editors expands the CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox and can be a valuable addition for synthetic biology.",

In Phelipanche ramosa, strigolactone‐induced germination was shown to require one of the CYP707A proteins involved in abscisic acid catabolism. Here, germination and gene expression were analyzed to investigate the role of CYP707As in germination of both parasitic plants and Arabidopsis upon perception of germination stimulants, after using pharmacological inhibitors and Arabidopsis mutants disrupting germination signals. CYP707A genes were up‐regulated upon treatment with effective germination stimulants in both parasitic plants and Arabidopsis. Obligate parasitic plants exhibited both an intensified up‐regulation of CYP707A genes and increased sensitivity to the CYP707A inhibitor Abscinazole‐E2B, while Arabidopsis cyp707a mutants still positively responded to germination stimulation. In Arabidopsis, CYP707A regulation required the canonical karrikin signaling pathway KAI2/MAX2/SMAX1 and the transcription factor WRKY33. Finally, CYP707As and WRKY33 also modulated Arabidopsis root architecture in response to the synthetic strigolactone rac‐GR24, and wrky33‐1 exhibited a shoot hyper‐branched phenotype. This study suggests that the lack of host‐independent germination in obligate parasites is associated with an exacerbated CYP707A induction, and that CYP707As and WRKY33 are new players involved in a variety of strigolactone/karrikin responses.",

Despite the increased appreciation of the essential role of the TOR complex in plants, no large-scale phosphoproteomics or interactomics studies have been performed to map TOR signalling events in plants. To fill this gap, we combined a systematic phosphoproteomics screen with a targeted protein complex analysis in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Integration of the phosphoproteome and protein complex data on the one hand shows that both methods reveal complementary subspaces of the plant TOR signalling network, enabling proteome-wide discovery of both upstream and downstream network components. On the other hand, the overlap between both data sets reveals a set of candidate direct TOR substrates. The integrated network embeds both evolutionarily-conserved and plant-specific TOR signalling components, uncovering an intriguing complex interplay with protein synthesis. Overall, the network provides a rich data set to start addressing fundamental questions about how TOR controls key processes in plants, such as autophagy, auxin signalling, chloroplast development, lipid metabolism, nucleotide biosynthesis, protein translation or senescence.",

Integral membrane proteins were found to interact with presenilin 2, whereas secreted proteins were found to interact with PEN-2.

A variety of plasmonic nanostructures have been developed for SERS signal excitation and collection in a conventional free-space microscope, among which the gold nanodomes offer one of the highest SERS enhancements. Nanophotonic waveguides have recently emerged as an alternative to the conventional Raman microscope as they can be used to efficiently excite and collect Raman signals. Integration of plasmonic structures on nanophotonic waveguides enables reproducible waveguide-based excitation and collection of SERS spectra, such as in nanoplasmonic slot waveguides. In this paper, we compare the SERS performance of gold nanodomes, in which the signal is excited and collected in free space, and waveguide-based nanoplasmonic slot waveguide. We evaluate the SERS signal enhancement and the SERS background of the different SERS platforms using a monolayer of nitrothiophenol. We show that the nanoplasmonic slot waveguide approaches the gold nanodomes in terms of the signal-to-background ratio. We additionally demonstrate the first-time detection of a peptide monolayer on a waveguide-based SERS platform, paving the way towards the SERS monitoring of biologically relevant molecules on an integrated lab-on-a-chip platform.",

They influence a myriad of both above- and belowground developmental processes, and are an important survival strategy for plants in nutrient-deprived soils. A rapidly emerging approach to gain knowledge on hormone signaling is the use of traceable analogs. A unique class of labeled SL analogs was constructed, where the original tricyclic lactone moiety of natural SLs is replaced by a fluorescent cyanoisoindole ring system. Biological evaluation as parasitic seed germination stimulant and hypocotyl elongation repressor proved the potency of the cyanoisoindole strigolactone analogs (CISA) to be comparable to the commonly accepted standard GR24. Additionally, via a SMXL6 protein degradation assay, we provided molecular evidence that the compounds elicit SL-like responses through the natural signaling cascade. All CISA analogs were shown to exhibit fluorescent properties, and the high quantum yield and Stokes shift of the pyrroloindole derivative CISA-7 also enabled in vivo visualization in plants. In contrast to the previously reported fluorescent analogs, CISA-7 displays a large similarity in shape and structure with natural SLs, which renders the analog a promising tracer to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of SLs in plants and fungi.",

Transgenic barley with reduced HvPRT6 expression showed enhanced resistance to Ps. japonica and Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, indicating a conserved role of the pathway.

We identified EXPANSIN A1 (EXPA1) as a cell wall modifying enzyme controlling the divisions marking lateral root initiation. Loss of EXPA1 leads to defects in the first asymmetric pericycle cell divisions and the radial swelling of the pericycle during auxin-driven lateral root formation.

First, the PPI networks are usually highly dynamic, and the in vivo interactions are often transient and difficult to detect. Therefore, the properties of the PPIs under study need to be considered to select the most suitable technique, because each has its own advantages and limitations. Second, besides knowledge on the interacting partners of a protein of interest, characteristics of the interaction, such as the spatial or temporal dynamics, are highly important. Hence, multiple approaches have to be combined to obtain a comprehensive view on the PPI network present in a cell.

H2O2 oxidizes proteinaceous cysteinyl thiols to sulfenic acid, also known as S-sulfenylation, thereby affecting the protein conformation and functionality. Although many proteins have been identified as S-sulfenylation targets in plants, site-specific mapping and quantification remain largely unexplored. By means of a peptide-centric chemoproteomics approach, we mapped 1,537 S-sulfenylated sites on more than 1,000 proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana cells. Proteins involved in RNA homeostasis and metabolism were identified as hotspots for S-sulfenylation. Moreover, S-sulfenylation frequently occurred on cysteines located at catalytic sites of enzymes or on cysteines involved in metal binding, hinting at a direct mode of action for redox regulation. Comparison of human and Arabidopsis S-sulfenylation datasets provided 155 conserved S-sulfenylated cysteines, including Cys181 of the Arabidopsis MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE4 (AtMAPK4) that corresponds to Cys161 in the human MAPK1, which has been identified previously as being S-sulfenylated. We show that, by replacing Cys181 of recombinant AtMAPK4 by a redox-insensitive serine residue, the kinase activity decreased, indicating the importance of this noncatalytic cysteine for the kinase mechanism. Altogether, we quantitatively mapped the S-sulfenylated cysteines in Arabidopsis cells under H2O2 stress and thereby generated a comprehensive view on the S-sulfenylation landscape that will facilitate downstream plant redox studies.",

Pollen proteases of all three plant species were characterized by zymography and those of white birch were fully identified for the first time as serine proteases of the subtilase family and meiotic prophase aminopeptidase 1 using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Together, our findings demonstrate that pollen proteases selectively and irreversibly damage integrity and anchorage of columnar respiratory epithelial cells.

While the typhoidal serovars (Typhi and Paratyphi A) are human-restricted and cause enteric fever, non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars (Typhimurium and Enteritidis) have a broad host range and predominantly cause gastroenteritis. \r\nMethodology/Principle findings: We compared the core proteomes of Salmonella Typhi, Paratyphi A, Typhimurium and Enteritidis using contemporary proteomics. For each serovar, five clinical isolates (covering different geographical origins) and one reference strain were grown in vitro to the exponential phase. Levels of orthologous proteins quantified in all four serovars and within the typhoidal and non-typhoidal groups were compared and subjected to gene ontology term enrichment and inferred regulatory interactions. Differential expression of the core proteomes of the typhoidal serovars appears mainly related to cell surface components and, for the non-typhoidal serovars, to pathogenicity. \r\nConclusions/Significance: Our comparative proteome analysis indicated differences in the expression of surface proteins between Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A, and in pathogenesis-related proteins between Salmonella Typhimurium and Enteritidis. Our findings may guide future development of novel diagnostics and vaccines, as well as understanding of disease progression. \r\nAuthor summary: With an estimated 20 million typhoid cases and an even higher number of non-typhoid cases the health burden caused by salmonellosis is huge. Salmonellosis is caused by the bacterial species Salmonella enterica and over 2500 different serovars exist, of which four are of major medical relevance for humans: Typhi and Paratyphi A cause typhoid fever while Typhimurium and Enteritidis are the dominant cause of non-typhoidal Salmonella infections. The proteome is the entire set of proteins that is expressed by a genome and the core proteome are all orthologous proteins detected in a given sample set. In this study we have investigated differential expression of the core proteomes of the Salmonella serovars Typhi, Paratyphi A, Typhimurium and Enteritidis, as well as the regulating molecules. Our comparative proteome analysis indicated differences in the expression of surface proteins between the serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A, and in pathogenesis-related proteins between Typhimurium and Enteritidis. Our findings in proteome-wide expression may guide the development of novel diagnostics and vaccines for Salmonella, as well as understanding of disease.",

Modern mass spectrometry technologies enable comprehensive identification and quantification of various PTMs. Given the increased numbers and types of mapped protein modifications, a database is necessary that simultaneously integrates and compares site‐specific information for different PTMs, especially in plants for which the available PTM data are poorly catalogued. Here, we present the Plant PTM Viewer (http://www.psb.ugent.be/PlantPTMViewer), an integrative PTM resource that comprises approximately 370,000 PTM sites for 19 types of protein modifications in plant proteins from five different species. The Plant PTM Viewer provides the user with a protein sequence overview in which the experimentally evidenced PTMs are highlighted together with an estimate of the confidence by which the modified peptides and, if possible, the actual modification sites were identified and with functional protein domains or active site residues. The PTM sequence search tool can query PTM combinations in specific protein sequences, whereas the PTM BLAST tool searches for modified protein sequences to detect conserved PTMs in homologous sequences. Taken together, these tools help to assume the role and potential interplay of PTMs in specific proteins or within a broader systems biology context. The Plant PTM Viewer is an open repository that allows the submission of mass spectrometry‐based PTM data to remain at pace with future PTM plant studies.",

However, EV data interpretation remains challenging owing to complexity of biofluids and technical variation introduced during sample preparation and analysis. To understand and mitigate these limitations, we generated trackable recombinant EV (rEV) as a biological reference material. Employing complementary characterization methods, we demonstrate that rEV are stable and bear physical and biochemical traits characteristic of sample EV. Furthermore, rEV can be quantified using fluorescence-, RNA- and protein-based technologies available in routine laboratories. Spiking rEV in biofluids allows recovery efficiencies of commonly implemented EV separation methods to be identified, intra-method and inter-user variability induced by sample handling to be defined, and to normalize and improve sensitivity of EV enumerations. We anticipate that rEV will aid EV-based sample preparation and analysis, data normalization, method development and instrument calibration in various research and biomedical applications.",

Dysregulation of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)-induced Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling leads to chronic inflammation and is associated with several human inflammatory pathologies. Hence, TNF neutralization suppresses inflammation and attenuates inflammatory pathology. However, despite its beneficial effects, anti-TNF therapy suffers from efficacy issues and severe immune side effects. There is thus an urging need to identify novel targets for pharmaceutical intervention in the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Here, we present a protein-protein interaction dataset of the TNFR1-induced signaling pathway. For this, we used Virotrap, a novel method for studying protein complexes without disrupting the cellular integrity, on 12 central proteins controlling NF-kappa B and cell death signaling, both under resting conditions as well as upon TNF stimulation. Our dataset reveals dynamic interactions in TNFR1-induced NF-kappa B signaling and identifies both known as well as novel interactors that may help to further unravel the molecular mechanisms steering TNF-induced inflammatory signaling and pathology.",

These proteins show extreme structural heterogeneity and have complex posttranslational modification patterns, due to which traditional structural biology techniques provide results that are often difficult to interpret. As demonstrated through the example of two such multidomain proteins, CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its paralogue, p300, even the expression and purification of such proteins are compromised by their extreme proteolytic sensitivity and structural heterogeneity. \r\nIn this chapter, we describe the effective expression of CBP and p300 in a eukaryotic host, Sf9 insect cells, followed by their tandem affinity purification based on two terminal tags to ensure their structural integrity. The major focus of this chapter is on the development of novel accessory tools, single-domain camelid antibodies (nanobodies), for structural-functional characterization. Specific nanobodies against full-length CBP and p300 can specifically target their different regions and can be used for their marking, labeling, and structural stabilization in a broad range of in vitro and in vivo studies. Here, we describe four high-affinity nanobodies binding to the KIX and the HAT domains, either mimicking known interacting partners or revealing new functionally relevant conformations. As immunization of llamas results in nanobody libraries with a great sequence variation, deep sequencing and interaction analysis with different regions of the proteins provide a novel approach toward developing a panel of specific nanobodies.",

Serum calciprotein particles (CPPs) have been linked to chronic kidney disease (CKD) calcification propensity, but additional knowledge is required to understand their function, assemblage, and composition. The role of other circulating nanostructures, such as extracellular vesicles (EVs) in vascular calcification is currently unknown. Here, we investigated the association of GRP (Gla-rich protein) with circulating CPP and EVs and the role of CKD CPPs and EVs in vascular calcification. \r\nApproach and Results: Biological CPPs and EVs were isolated from healthy and CKD patients and comparatively characterized using ultrastructural, analytic, molecular, and immuno-based techniques. Our results show that GRP is a constitutive component of circulating CPPs and EVs. CKD stage 5 serum CPPs and EVs are characterized by lower levels of fetuin-A and GRP, and CPPs CKD stage 5 have increased mineral maturation, resembling secondary CPP particles. Vascular smooth muscle cell calcification assays reveal that CPPs CKD stage 5 and EVs CKD stage 5 are taken up by vascular smooth muscle cells and induce vascular calcification by promoting cell osteochondrogenic differentiation and inflammation. These effects were rescued by incubation of CPPs CKD stage 5 with -carboxylated GRP. In vitro, formation and maturation of basic calcium phosphate crystals was highly reduced in the presence of -carboxylated GRP, fetuin-A, and MGP (matrix gla protein), and a similar antimineralization system was identified in vivo. \r\nConclusions: Uremic CPPs and EVs are important players in the mechanisms of widespread calcification in CKD. We propose a major role for cGRP as inhibitory factor to prevent calcification at systemic and tissue levels.",

In contrast with yeast and metazoan DUB modules that are associated with the large SAGA complex, the Arabidopsis DUBm only comprises three proteins (hereafter named SGF11, ENY2 and UBP22) and appears to act independently as a major H2Bub deubiquitinase activity. Our study further unveils that DET1-DDB1-Associated-1 (DDA1) protein interacts with SGF11 in vivo, linking the DET1 complex to light-dependent ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic degradation of the DUBm. Collectively, these findings uncover a signaling path controlling DUBm availability, potentially adjusting H2Bub turnover capacity to the cell transcriptional status.",

In A. thaliana, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), provoked during biotic and abiotic stress, influence the activity of GSTU23. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of oxidative stress on the function and structure of GSTU23. \r\nMethods: The impact of oxidation on the function of GSTU23 was studied using a glutathione transferase biochemical assay and mass spectrometry. With kinetics, circular dichroism and thermodynamics, we compared reduced with oxidized GSTU23. X-ray crystal structures of GSTU23 visualize the impact of oxidation on methionines and cysteines. \r\nResults: In the presence of 100 mu M H2O2, oxidation of the methionine side-chain to a sulfoxide is the prominent post-translational modification, which can be reduced by C. diphtheriae MsrA and MsrB. However, increasing the level to 200 mu M H2O2 results in a reversible intramolecular disulfide between Cys65-Cys110, which is substrate for glutaredoxin. Under these oxidizing conditions, GSTU23 undergoes a structural change and forms a more favourable enzyme-substrate complex to overcome k(cat) decrease. \r\nConclusions and significance: At lower H2O2 levels (100 mu M), GSTU23 forms methionine sulfoxides. Specifically, oxidation of Met14, located near the catalytic Ser13, could interfere with both GSH binding and catalytic activation. At higher H2O2 levels (200 mu M), the Cys65-Cys110 disulfide bond protects other cysteines and also methionines from overoxidation. This study shows the impact of oxidative stress on GSTU23 regulated by methionine sulfoxide reductases and glutaredoxin, and the mechanisms involved in maintaining its catalytic functionality under oxidizing conditions.",

Diverse environmental stimuli inhibit leaf growth to cope with the perceived stress. In plant research, mannitol is often used to impose osmotic stress and study the underlying growth-repressing mechanisms. In growing leaf tissue of plants briefly exposed to mannitol-induced stress, a highly interconnected gene regulatory network is induced. However, early signalling and associated protein phosphorylation events that probably precede part of these transcriptional changes and that potentially act at the onset of mannitol-induced leaf size reduction are largely unknown. Here, we performed a proteome and phosphoproteome analysis on growing leaf tissue of Arabidopsis thaliana plants exposed to mild mannitol-induced stress and captured the fast (within the first half hour) events associated with this stress. Based on this in-depth data analysis, 167 and 172 differentially regulated proteins and phosphorylated sites were found. We provide these data sets as a community resource and we flag differentially phosphorylated proteins with described growth-regulatory functions, but we also illustrate potential novel regulators of shoot growth.",

The attachment of N-glycans to proteins can modulate their properties and influences numerous important biological processes, such as protein folding and cellular attachment. Recently, it has been shown that protein N-glycosylation plays a vital role in insect development and survival, which makes the glycans an interesting target for pest control. Despite the importance of protein N-glycosylation in insects, knowledge about insect N-glycoproteomes is scarce. To fill this gap, the N-glycosites were identified in proteins from three major pest insects, spanning different insect orders and diverging in post-embryonic development, feeding mechanism and evolutionary ancestry: Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera), Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera) and Acyrthosiphon pisum (Hemiptera). The N-glyco-FASP method for isolation of N-glycopeptides was optimized to study the insect N-glycosites and allowed the identification of 889 N-glycosylation sites in T. castaneum, 941 in D. melanogaster and 1338 in A. pisum. Although a large set of the corresponding glycoproteins is shared among the three insects, species- and order-specific glycoproteins were also identified. The functionality of the insect glycoproteins together with the conservation of the N-glycosites throughout evolution is discussed. This information can help in the elaboration of novel pest insect control strategies based on interference in insect glycosylation.",

Crossovers resulting from the repair of meiotic breaks are essential for proper chromosome segregation and increase genetic diversity of the progeny. However, mechanisms regulating crossover formation remain elusive. Here, we identified through genetic and protein-protein interaction screens FIDGETIN-LIKE-1 INTERACTING PROTEIN (FLIP) as a new partner of the previously characterized anti-crossover factor FIDGETIN-LIKE-1 (FIGL1) in Arabidopsis thaliana. We showed that FLIP limits meiotic crossover together with FIGL1. Further, FLIP and FIGL1 form a protein complex conserved from Arabidopsis to human. FIGL1 interacts with the recombinases RAD51 and DMC1, the enzymes that catalyze the DNA strand exchange step of homologous recombination. Arabidopsis flip mutants recapitulate the figl1 phenotype, with enhanced meiotic recombination associated with change in counts of DMC1 and RAD51 foci. Our data thus suggests that FLIP and FIGL1 form a conserved complex that regulates the crucial step of strand invasion in homologous recombination.",

Fluorescent protein tags are used to visualize protein localization, and affinity tags enable the mapping of molecular interactions by, for example, tandem affinity purification or chromatin immunoprecipitation. To apply these widely used molecular techniques on a single transgenic plant line, we developed a multifunctional tandem affinity purification tag, named GS(yellow), which combines the streptavidin-binding peptide tag with citrine yellow fluorescent protein. We demonstrated the versatility of the GS(yellow) tag in the dicot Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) using a set of benchmark proteins. For proof of concept in monocots, we assessed the localization and dynamic interaction profile of the leaf growth regulator ANGUSTIFOLIA3 (AN3), fused to the GS(yellow) tag, along the growth zone of the maize (Zea mays) leaf. To further explore the function of ZmAN3, we mapped its DNA-binding landscape in the growth zone of the maize leaf through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. Comparison with AN3 target genes mapped in the developing maize tassel or in Arabidopsis cell cultures revealed strong conservation of AN3 target genes between different maize tissues and across monocots and dicots, respectively. In conclusion, the GS(yellow) tag offers a powerful molecular tool for distinct types of protein functional analyses in dicots and monocots. As this approach involves transforming a single construct, it is likely to accelerate both basic and translational plant research.",

A20 is thought to restrict NF-kappa B activation both by its ubiquitin-editing activity as well as by its nonenzymatic activities. Besides its role in NF-kappa B signaling, A20 also acts as a protective factor inhibiting apoptosis and necroptosis. Because of the ability of A20 to both ubiquitinate and deubiquitinate substrates, and its involvement in many cellular processes, we hypothesized that deletion of A20 might generally impact on protein levels, thereby disrupting cellular signaling. We performed a differential proteomics study on bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from control and myeloid-specific A20 knockout mice, both in untreated conditions and after LPS or TNF treatment, and demonstrated A20-dependent changes in protein expression. Several inflammatory proteins were found up-regulated in the absence of A20, even without an inflammatory stimulus, but, depending on the treatment and the treatment time, more proteins were found regulated. Together these protein changes may affect normal signaling events, which may disturb tissue homeostasis and induce (autoimmune) inflammation, in agreement with A20s proposed identity as a susceptibility gene for inflammatory disease. We further verify that immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1) is up-regulated in the absence of A20 and that its levels are transcriptionally regulated.",

Endothelial loss of FASN impaired angiogenesis in vivo, while FASN blockade reduced pathological ocular neovascularization, at >10-fold lower doses than used for anti-cancer treatment. Impaired angiogenesis was not due to energy stress, redox imbalance, or palmitate depletion. Rather, FASN(KD) elevated malonyl-CoA levels, causing malonylation (a post-translational modification) of mTOR at lysine 1218 (K1218). mTOR K-1218 malonylation impaired mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase activity, thereby reducing phosphorylation of downstream targets (p70S6K/4EBP1). Silencing acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (an enzyme producing malonyl-CoA) normalized malonyl-CoA levels and reactivated mTOR in FASN(KD) ECs. Mutagenesis unveiled the importance of mTOR K1218 malonylation for angiogenesis.

By trapping LZTR1 complexes from intact mammalian cells, we identified the guanosine triphosphatase RAS as a substrate for the LZTR1-CUL3 complex. Ubiquitome analysis showed that loss of Lztrl abrogated Ras ubiquitination at lysine-170. LZTR-mediated ubiquitination inhibited RAS signaling by attenuating its association with the membrane.

            "abstract": "N-terminal acetylation (Nt-acetylation) is a highly abundant protein modification in eukaryotes and impacts a wide range of cellular processes, including protein quality control and stress tolerance. Despite its prevalence, the mechanisms regulating Nt-acetylation are still nebulous. Here, we present the first global study of Nt-acetylation in yeast cells as they progress to stationary phase in response to nutrient starvation. Surprisingly, we found that yeast cells maintain their global Nt-acetylation levels upon nutrient depletion, despite a marked decrease in acetyl-CoA levels. We further observed two distinct sets of protein N termini that display differential and opposing Nt-acetylation behavior upon nutrient starvation, indicating a dynamic process. The first protein cluster was enriched for annotated N termini showing increased Nt-acetylation in stationary phase compared with exponential growth phase. The second protein cluster was conversely enriched for alternative nonannotated N termini (i.e. N termini indicative of shorter N-terminal proteoforms) and, like histones, showed reduced acetylation levels in stationary phase when acetyl-CoA levels were low. Notably, the degree of Nt-acetylation of Pcl8, a negative regulator of glycogen biosynthesis and two components of the pre-ribosome complex (Rsa3 and Rpl7a) increased during starvation. Moreover, the steady-state levels of these proteins were regulated both by starvation and NatA activity. In summary, this study represents the first comprehensive analysis of metabolic regulation of Nt-acetylation and reveals that specific, rather than global, Nt-acetylation events are subject to metabolic regulation.",

            "abstract": "Actin, one of the most abundant proteins in nature, participates in countless cellular functions ranging from organelle trafficking and pathogen motility to cell migration and regulation of gene transcription. Actin's cellular activities depend on the dynamic transition between its monomeric and filamentous forms, a process exquisitely regulated in cells by a large number of actin-binding and signaling proteins. Additionally, several posttranslational modifications control the cellular functions of actin, including most notably N-terminal (Nt)-acetylation, a prevalent modification throughout the animal kingdom. However, the biological role and mechanism of actin Nt-acetylation are poorly understood, and the identity of actin's N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) has remained a mystery. Here, we reveal that NAA80, a suggested NAT enzyme whose substrate specificity had not been characterized, is Nt-acetylating actin. We further show that actin Nt-acetylation plays crucial roles in cytoskeletal assembly in vitro and in cells. The absence of Nt-acetylation leads to significant differences in the rates of actin filament depolymerization and elongation, including elongation driven by formins, whereas filament nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex is mostly unaffected. NAA80-knockout cells display severely altered cytoskeletal organization, including an increase in the ratio of filamentous to globular actin, increased filopodia and lamellipodia formation, and accelerated cell motility. Together, the results demonstrate NAA80's role as actin's NAT and reveal a crucial role for actin Nt-acetylation in the control of cytoskeleton structure and dynamics.",

Despite the development of increasingly sensitive analytical tools, the enormous biomolecular complexity that exists within a cell cannot yet be fully resolved as low abundant molecules often remain unrecognized. Moreover, a drawback of whole cell analysis is that it does not provide spatial information and therefore it is not capable of assigning distinct biomolecules to specific compartments or analyzing changes in the composition of these compartments. Reduction of the biomolecular complexity of a sample helps to identify low abundant molecules, but such a reductionist approach requires methods that enable proper isolation and purification of individual cellular organelles. Decades of research have led to the development of a plethora of isolation methods for a broad range of subcellular organelles; yet, in particular, intrinsically dynamic compartments belonging to the endocytic machinery, including the plasma membrane, remain difficult to isolate in a sufficiently pure fraction. In this review, we discuss various methods that are commonly used to isolate subcellular organelles from cells and evaluate their advantages and disadvantages.",

Therefore, identifying early signaling events in host plants that play an important role in establishing the infection process will help our understanding of the disease process. In this context, phosphorylation constitutes one of the most important post-translational protein modifications, regulating many cellular signaling processes. In this study, we aimed to identify the processes affected by infection with Peanut stunt virus (PSV) and its satellite RNA (satRNA) in Nicotiana benthamiana at the early stage of pathogenesis. To achieve this, we performed proteome and phosphoproteome analyses on plants treated with PSV and its satRNA. The analysis of the number of differentially phosphorylated proteins showed strong down-regulation in phosphorylation in virus-treated plants (without satRNA). Moreover, proteome analysis revealed more down-regulated proteins in PSV and satRNA-treated plants, which indicated a complex dependence between proteins and their modifications. Apart from changes in photosynthesis and carbon metabolism, which are usually observed in virus-infected plants, alterations in proteins involved in RNA synthesis, transport, and turnover were observed. As a whole, this is the first community (phospho)proteome resource upon infection of N. benthamiana with a cucumovirus and its satRNA and this resource constitutes a valuable data set for future studies.",

We present here a rigorous proteomic analysis that monitored the changes in protein expression during differentiation of H9C2 cells into cardiomyocyte-like cells over time. Quantitative mass spectrometry followed by gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that early changes in H9C2 differentiation are related to protein pathways of cardiac muscle morphogenesis and sphingolipid synthesis. These changes in the proteome were followed later in the differentiation time-course by alterations in the expression of proteins involved in cation transport and beta-oxidation. Studying the temporal profile of the H9C2 proteome during differentiation in further detail revealed eight clusters of co-regulated proteins that can be associated with early, late, continuous and transient up- and downregulation. Subsequent reactome pathway analysis based on these eight clusters further corroborated and detailed the results of the GO analysis. Specifically, this analysis confirmed that proteins related to pathways in muscle contraction are upregulated early and transiently, and proteins relevant to extracellular matrix organization are downregulated early. In contrast, upregulation of proteins related to cardiac metabolism occurs at later time points. Finally, independent validation of the proteomics results by immunoblotting confirmed hereto unknown regulators of cardiac structure and ionic metabolism. Our results are consistent with a function follows form' model of differentiation, whereby early and transient alterations of structural proteins enable subsequent changes that are relevant to the characteristic physiology of cardiomyocytes.",

Therefore, in proteomics research, the discovery of what actually triggers, regulates or interrupts the composition of protein complexes is gaining importance. Here, tandem affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) is combined with label-free quantification (LFQ) to a highly valuable tool to detect physiologically relevant, dynamic protein-protein interactions in Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures.

RIPK4 signaling pathways controlling keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation depend on its kinase activity leading to Dvl2, Pkp1 and IRF6 phosphorylation and NF-kappa B activation. However, the mechanism regulating RIPK4 activity levels remains elusive. We show that cultured keratinocytes display constitutive active phosphorylated RIPK4 while PKC signaling can trigger RIPK4 activation in various non-keratinocyte cell lines, in which RIPK4 is present in a non-phosphorylated state. Interestingly, we identified the SCF beta-TrCP ubiquitin E3 ligase complex responsible for regulating the active RIPK4 protein level. The SCF beta-TrCP complex binds to a conserved phosphodegron motif in the intermediate domain of RIPK4, subsequently leading to K48-linked ubiquitinylation and degradation. The recruitment of beta-TrCP is dependent on RIPK4 activation and trans-autophosphorylation. beta-TrCP knock-down resulted in RIPK4-dependent formation of actin stress fibers, cell scattering and increased cell motility, suggesting that tight control of RIPK4 activity levels is crucial to maintain cell shape and behavior in keratinocytes.",

Because these heterotrophic plants severely damage their hosts even before emerging from the soil, there is an unequivocal need to design early and efficient methods for their control. The germination process of these species has probably undergone numerous selective pressure events in the course of evolution, in that the perception of host derived molecules is a necessary condition for seeds to germinate. Although most of these molecules belong to the strigolactones, structurally different molecules have been identified. Since strigolactones are also classified as novel plant hormones that regulate several physiological processes other than germination, the use of autotrophic model plant species has allowed the identification of many actors involved in the strigolactone biosynthesis, perception, and signal transduction pathways. Nevertheless, many questions remain to be answered regarding the germination process of parasitic plants. For instance, how did parasitic plants evolve to germinate in response to a wide variety of molecules, while autotrophic plants do not? What particular features are associated with their lack of spontaneous germination? In this review, we attempt to illustrate to what extent conclusions from research into strigolactones could be applied to better understand the biology of parasitic plants.",

Interfering with early synaptic dysfunction may be therapeutically beneficial to prevent cognitive decline and disease progression, but the mechanisms underlying synaptic defects associated with Tau are unclear. In disease conditions, Tau mislocalizes into pre- and postsynaptic compartments; here we show that, under pathological conditions, Tau binds to presynaptic vesicles in Alzheimer's disease patient brain. We define that the binding of Tau to synaptic vesicles is mediated by the transmembrane vesicle protein Synaptogyrin-3. In fly and mouse models of Tauopathy, reduction of Synaptogyrin-3 prevents the association of presynaptic Tau with vesicles, alleviates Tau-induced defects in vesicle mobility, and restores neurotransmitter release. This work therefore identifies Synaptogyrin-3 as the binding partner of Tau on synaptic vesicles, revealing a new presynapse-specific Tau interactor, which may contribute to early synaptic dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases associated with Tau.",

Specifically, processes during wheat leaf, flower, and seed development and photosynthesis, which all contribute to the yield of this crop, are affected by high temperature. While this has to some extent been investigated on physiological, developmental, and molecular levels, very little is known about early signalling events associated with an increase in temperature. Phosphorylation-mediated signalling mechanisms, which are quick and dynamic, are associated with plant growth and development, also under abiotic stress conditions. Therefore, we probed the impact of a short-term and mild increase in temperature on the wheat leaf and spikelet phosphoproteome. In total, 3822 (containing 5178 phosphosites) and 5581 phosphopeptides (containing 7023 phosphosites) were identified in leaf and spikelet samples, respectively. Following statistical analysis, the resulting data set provides the scientific community with a first large-scale plant phosphoproteome under the control of higher ambient temperature. This community resource on the high temperature-mediated wheat phosphoproteome will be valuable for future studies. Our analyses also revealed a core set of common proteins between leaf and spikelet, suggesting some level of conserved regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, we observed temperature-regulated interconversion of phosphoforms, which probably impacts protein activity.",

Compound A (CpdA), identified as a selective NR3C1/glucocorticoid receptor (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1) modulator, exhibits an inflammation-suppressive effect, largely in the absence of detrimental side effects. To understand the mechanistic differences between the classic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) and CpdA, we looked for proteins oppositely regulated in bone marrow-derived macrophages using an unbiased proteomics approach. We found that the autophagy receptor SQSTM1 but not NR3C1 mediates the anti-inflammatory action of CpdA. CpdA drives SQSTM1 upregulation by recruiting the NFE2L2 transcription factor to its promoter. In contrast, the classic NR3C1 ligand dexamethasone recruits NR3C1 to the Sqstm1 promoter and other NFE2L2-controlled gene promoters, resulting in gene downregulation. Both DEX and CpdA induce autophagy, with marked different autophagy characteristics and morphology. Suppression of LPS-induced Il6 and Ccl2 genes by CpdA in macrophages is hampered upon Sqstm1 silencing, confirming that SQSTM1 is essential for the anti-inflammatory capacity of CpdA, at least in this cell type. Together, these results demonstrate how off-target mechanisms of selective NR3C1 ligands may contribute to a more efficient anti-inflammatory therapy.",

These features allowed us to establish standardized magnetic isolation procedures for these membrane compartments with a yield and purity permitting proteomic and lipidomic profiling. We validated our approach by comparing the biomolecular compositions of lysosomes and plasma membranes isolated from wild-type and Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1) deficient cells. While the accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids is seen as a primary hallmark of NPC1 deficiency, our lipidomics analysis revealed the buildup of several species of glycerophospholipids and other storage lipids in selectively late endosomes/lysosomes of NPC1-KO cells. While the plasma membrane proteome remained largely invariable, we observed pronounced alterations in several proteins linked to autophagy and lysosomal catabolism reflecting vesicular transport obstruction and defective lysosomal turnover resulting from NPC1 deficiency. Thus the use of SPIONs provides a major advancement in fingerprinting subcellular compartments, with an increased potential to identify disease-related alterations in their biomolecular compositions.",

These functions are exerted through direct and indirect interactions with the lamina's major constituent proteins, the A-type lamins, which are encoded by the LMNA gene. Using quantitative stable isotope labeling-based shotgun proteomics we have analyzed the proteome of human dermal fibroblasts in which we have depleted A-type lamins by means of a sustained siRNA-mediated LMNA knockdown. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the largest fraction of differentially produced proteins was involved in actin cytoskeleton organization, in particular proteins involved in focal adhesion dynamics, such as actin-related protein 2 and 3 (ACTR2/3), subunits of the ARP2/3 complex, and fascin actin-bundling protein 1 (FSCN1). Functional validation using quantitative immunofluorescence showed a significant reduction in the size of focal adhesion points in A-type lamin depleted cells, which correlated with a reduction in early cell adhesion capacity and an increased cell motility. At the same time, loss of A-type lamins led to more pronounced stress fibers and higher traction forces. This phenotype could not be mimicked or reversed by experimental modulation of the STAT3-IL6 pathway, but it was partly recapitulated by chemical inhibition of the ARP2/3 complex. Thus, our data suggest that the loss of A-type lamins perturbs the balance between focal adhesions and cytoskeletal tension. This imbalance may contribute to mechanosensing defects observed in certain laminopathies.",

Using the multimodule protein testin (TES), we here report a proteomics approach to increase insight in cocomplex diversity. The LIM-domain containing and tumor suppressor protein TES is present at different actin cytoskeleton adhesion structures in cells and influences cell migration, adhesion and spreading. TES module accessibility has been proposed to vary due to conformational switching and variants of TES lacking specific domains target to different subcellular locations. By applying iMixPro AP-MS (\"intelligent Mixing of Proteomes\"-affinity purification-mass spectrometry) to a set of tagged-TES modular variants, we identified proteins residing in module-specific cocomplexes. The obtained distinct module-specific interactomes combine to a global TES interactome that becomes more extensive and richer in information. Applying pathway analysis to the module interactomes revealed expected actin-related canonical pathways and also less expected pathways. We validated two new TES cocomplex partners: TGFB1I1 and a short form of the glucocorticoid receptor. TES and TGFB1I1 are shown to oppositely affect cell spreading providing biological validity for their copresence in complexes since they act in similar processes.",

Not only are peptides and plasmonic hotspots similarly sized, Raman fingerprints also hold large potential for spectral multiplexing. Here, we use a gold-nanodome platform for real-time detection of trypsin activity on a CALNNYGGGGVRGNF substrate peptide. First, we investigate the spectral changes upon cleavage through the SERS signal of liquid-chromatography separated products. Next, we show that similar patterns are detected upon digesting surface-bound peptides. We demonstrate that the relative intensity of the fingerprints from aromatic amino acids before and after the cleavage site provides a robust figure of merit for the turnover rate. The presented method offers a generic approach for measuring protease activity, which is illustrated by developing an analogous substrate for endoproteinase Glu-C.",

            "abstract": "The multi-domain transcriptional coactivators CBP/p300 integrate a multitude of signaling inputs, interacting with more than 400 proteins via one or more of their globular domains. While CBP/ p300 function is typically considered in terms of these structured domains, about half of the protein consists of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of varying length. However, these IDRs have only been thought of as linkers that allow flexible spatial arrangement of the structured domains, but recent studies have shown that similar IDRs mediate specific and critical interactions in other proteins. To examine the roles of IDRs in CBP, we performed yeast-two-hybrid screenings of placenta and lung cancer cDNA libraries, which demonstrated that the long IDR linking the KIX domain and bromodomain of CBP (termed ID3) can potentially bind to several proteins. The RNA-binding Zinc-finger protein 106 (ZFP106) detected in both libraries was identified as a novel substrate for CBP-mediated acetylation. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with cross-linking experiments and competition-binding assays showed that the fully disordered isolated ID3 transiently interacts with an IDR of ZFP106 in a fashion that disorder of both regions is maintained. These findings demonstrate that beside the linking function, ID3 can also interact with acetylation substrates of CBP.",

Proteogenomic studies in which N-terminal proteomics and ribosome profiling are combined, suggest that a high number of protein start sites are currently missing in genome annotations. We constructed a proteogenomic pipeline specific for the analysis of N-terminal proteomics data, with the aim of discovering novel translational start sites outside annotated protein coding regions. In summary, unidentified MS/MS spectra were matched to a specific N-terminal peptide library encompassing protein N termini encoded in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. After a stringent false discovery rate filtering, 117 protein N termini compliant with N-terminal methionine excision specificity and indicative of translation initiation were found. These include N-terminal protein extensions and translation from transposable elements and pseudogenes. Gene prediction provided supporting protein-coding models for approximately half of the protein N termini. Besides the prediction of functional domains (partially) contained within the newly predicted ORFs, further supporting evidence of translation was found in the recently released Araport11 genome re-annotation of Arabidopsis and computational translations of sequences stored in public repositories. Most interestingly, complementary evidence by ribosome profiling was found for 23 protein N termini. Finally, by analyzing protein N-terminal peptides, an in silico analysis demonstrates the applicability of our N-terminal proteogenomics strategy in revealing protein-coding potential in species with well-and poorly-annotated genomes.",

However, little is known about possible differences in total protein levels of hexaploid versus tetraploid wheat cultivars, and also knowledge of phosphorylated wheat proteins is still limited. Here, we performed a detailed analysis of the proteome of seedling leaves from two hexaploid wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L. Pavon 76 and USU-Apogee) and one tetraploid wheat (T. turgidum ssp. durum cv. Senatore Cappelli). Our shotgun proteomics data revealed that, whereas we observed some significant differences, overall a high similarity between hexaploid and tetraploid varieties with respect to protein abundance was observed. In addition, already at the seedling stage, a small set of proteins was differential between the small (USU-Apogee) and larger hexaploid wheat cultivars (Pavon 76), which could potentially act as growth predictors. Finally, the phosphosites identified in this study can be retrieved from the in-house developed plant PTM-Viewer (bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/ptm_viewer/), making this the first searchable repository for phosphorylated wheat proteins. This paves the way for further in depth, quantitative (phospho) proteome-wide differential analyses upon a specific trigger or environmental change.",

Due to the high adverse effects associated with long-term use, GC pharmacology has focused since the nineties on more selective GC ligand-binding strategies, classified as selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonists (SEGRAs) or selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators (SEGRMs). In the current study, GSK866 analogs with electrophilic covalent-binding warheads were developed with potential SEGRA properties to improve their clinical safety profile for long-lasting topical skin disease applications. Since the off-rate of a covalently binding drug is negligible compared to that of a non-covalent drug, its therapeutic effects can be prolonged and typically, smaller doses of the drug are necessary to reach the same level of therapeutic efficacy, thereby potentially reducing systemic side effects. Different analogs of SEGRA GSK866 coupled to cysteine reactive warheads were characterized for GR potency and selectivity in various biochemical and cellular assays. GR-and NF kappa B dependent reporter gene studies show favorable anti-inflammatory properties with reduced GR transactivation of two non-steroidal GSK866 analogs UAMC-1217 and UAMC-1218, whereas UAMC-1158 and UAMC-1159 compounds failed to modulate cellular GR activity. These results were further supported by GR immuno-localization and S211 phospho-GR western analysis, illustrating significant GR phosphoactivation and nuclear translocation upon treatment of GSK866, UAMC-1217, or UAMC-1218, but not in case of UAMC-1158 or UAMC-1159. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic peptides of recombinant GR ligand-binding domain (LBD) bound to UAMC-1217 or UAMC-1218 confirmed covalent cysteine-dependent GR binding. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations, as well as glucocorticoid receptor ligand-binding domain (GR-LBD) coregulator interaction profiling of the GR-LBD bound to GSK866 or its covalently binding analogs UAMC-1217 or UAMC-1218 revealed subtle conformational differences that might underlie their SEGRA properties. Altogether, GSK866 analogs UAMC-1217 and UAMC-1218 hold promise as a novel class of covalent-binding SEGRA ligands for the treatment of topical inflammatory skin disorders.",

Karrikins, molecules produced upon fire, share MAX2 for signalling, but depend on the D14 paralog KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE 2 (KAI2) for perception with strong evidence that the MAX2-KAI2 protein complex might also recognize so far unknown plant-made karrikin-like molecules. Thus, the phenotypes of the max2 mutants are the complex consequence of a loss of both D14-dependent and KAI2-dependent signalling, hence, the reason why some biological roles, attributed to strigolactones based on max2 phenotypes, could never be observed in d14 or in the strigolactone-deficient max3 and max4 mutants. Moreover, the broadly used synthetic strigolactone analog rac-GR24 has been shown to mimic strigolactone as well as karrikin(-like) signals, providing an extra level of complexity in the distinction of the unique and common roles of both molecules in plant biology. Here, a critical overview is provided of the diverse biological processes regulated by strigolactones and/or karrikins. These two growth regulators are considered beyond their boundaries, and the importance of the yet unknown karrikin-like molecules is discussed as well.",

In hypoxia, HIF1 alpha partly escapes degradation because of low oxygen availability. Here, we show that PHD2 is phosphorylated on serine 125(S125) by the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) downstream kinase P70S6K and that this phosphorylation increases its ability to degrade HIF1 alpha. mTOR blockade in hypoxia by REDD1 restrains P70S6K and unleashes PP2A phosphatase activity. Through its regulatory subunit B55 alpha, PP2A directly dephosphorylates PHD2 on S125, resulting in a further reduction of PHD2 activity that ultimately boosts HIF1a accumulation. These events promote autophagy- mediated cell survival in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. B55 alpha knockdown blocks neoplastic growth of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo in a PHD2-dependent manner. In patients, CRC tissue expresses higher levels of REDD1, B55 alpha, and HIF1 alpha but has lower phospho-S125 PHD2 compared with a healthy colon. Our data disclose a mechanism of PHD2 regulation that involves the mTOR and PP2A pathways and controls tumor growth.",

These proteins accumulate particularly in short-day conditions and interact to form a complex. Loss-of-function of FRS7 and FRS12 results in early flowering plants with overly elongated hypocotyls mainly in short days. We demonstrate by molecular analysis that FRS7 and FRS12 affect these developmental processes in part by binding to the promoters and repressing the expression of GIGANTEA and PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 as well as several of their downstream signalling targets.

Transcriptomic analyses centred on metalloprotease genes unraveled a 50% decrease in ADAM30 expression that inversely correlates with amyloid load in Alzheimer's disease brains. Accordingly, in vitro down-or up-regulation of ADAM30 expression triggered an increase/decrease in A beta peptides levels whereas expression of a biologically inactive ADAM30 (ADAM30(mut)) did not affect A beta secretion. Proteomics/cell-based experiments showed that ADAM30-dependent regulation of APP metabolism required both cathepsin D (CTSD) activation and APP sorting to lysosomes. Accordingly, in Alzheimer-like transgenic mice, neuronal ADAM30 over-expression lowered A beta 42 secretion in neuron primary cultures, soluble A beta 42 and amyloid plaque load levels in the brain and concomitantly enhanced CTSD activity and finally rescued long term potentiation alterations. Our data thus indicate that lowering ADAM30 expression may favor A beta production, thereby contributing to Alzheimer's disease development. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",

With the recent advances in genome engineering, tagging of endogenous proteins is now within reach for most experimental systems, including mammalian cell lines cultures. In this work, we describe the selection of peptides with ideal mass spectrometry characteristics for use in quantification of tagged proteins using targeted proteomics. We mined the proteome of the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus to obtain two peptides that are unique in the proteomes of all known model organisms (proteotypic) and allow sensitive quantification of target proteins in a complex background. By combining these 'Proteotypic peptides for Quantification by SRM' (PQS peptides) with epitope tags, we demonstrate their use in co-immunoprecipitation experiments upon transfection of protein pairs, or after introduction of these tags in the endogenous proteins through genome engineering.

Vascin recapitulates key biophysical and biochemical characteristics of natural amyloids, penetrates cells, and seeds the aggregation of VEGFR2 through direct interaction. We found that amyloid toxicity is observed only in cells that both express VEGFR2 and are dependent on VEGFR2 activity for survival.

This suggested that ubiquitylated abscisic acid (ABA) receptors might be targeted to the vacuolar degradation pathway because such ubiquitylation is usually an internalization signal for the endocytic route. Here, we show that FYVE1 (previously termed FREE1), a recently described component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, interacted with RSL1-receptor complexes and recruited PYL4 to endosomal compartments. Although the ESCRT pathway has been assumed to be reserved for integral membrane proteins, we show the involvement of this pathway in the degradation of ABA receptors, which can be associated with membranes but are not integral membrane proteins. Knockdown fyve1 alleles are hypersensitive to ABA, illustrating the biological relevance of the ESCRT pathway for the modulation of ABA signaling. In addition, fyve1 mutants are impaired in the targeting of ABA receptors for vacuolar degradation, leading to increased accumulation of PYL4 and an enhanced response to ABA. Pharmacological and genetic approaches revealed a dynamic turnover of ABA receptors from the plasma membrane to the endosomal/vacuolar degradation pathway, which was mediated by FYVE1 and was dependent on RSL1. This process involves clathrin-mediated endocytosis and trafficking of PYL4 through the ESCRT pathway, which helps to regulate the turnover of ABA receptors and attenuate ABA signaling.",

Genome-wide mapping of bZIP29 target genes confirmed its role in stress and osmosensory responses, but also identified specific binding to several core cell cycle genes and to genes involved in cell wall organization. bZIP29 protein complex analyses validated interaction with other bZIP group I members and provided insight into regulatory mechanisms acting on bZIP dimers. In agreement with bZIP29 expression in proliferative tissues and with its binding to promoters of cell cycle regulators, dominant-negative repression of bZIP29 altered the cell number in leaves and in the root meristem. A transcriptome analysis on the root meristem, however, indicated that bZIP29 might regulate cell number through control of cell wall organization.

T1D results from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, whereas beta cell failure in T2D is delayed and progressive. Here we find a new genetic component of diabetes susceptibility in T1D non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, identifying immune-independent beta cell fragility. Genetic variation in Xrcc4 and Glis3 alters the response of NOD beta cells to unfolded protein stress, enhancing the apoptotic and senescent fates. The same transcriptional relationships were observed in human islets, demonstrating the role of beta cell fragility in genetic predisposition to diabetes.\r\nKeywords",

            "abstract": "Cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxins (GRXs) are required in iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster delivery and iron sensing in yeast and mammals. In plants, it is unclear whether they have similar functions. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) has a sole class II cytosolic monothiol GRX encoded by GRXS17. Here, we used tandem affinity purification to establish that Arabidopsis GRXS17 associates with most known cytosolic Fe-S assembly (CIA) components. Similar to mutant plants with defective CIA components, grxs17 loss-of-function mutants showed some degree of hypersensitivity to DNA damage and elevated expression of DNA damage marker genes. We also found that several putative Fe-S client proteins directly bind to GRXS17, such as XANTHINE DEHYDROGENASE1 (XDH1), involved in the purine salvage pathway, and CYTOSOLIC THIOURIDYLASE SUBUNIT1 and CYTOSOLIC THIOURIDYLASE SUBUNIT2, both essential for the 2-thiolation step of 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U) modification of tRNAs. Correspondingly, profiling of the grxs17-1 mutant pointed to a perturbed flux through the purine degradation pathway and revealed that it phenocopied mutants in the elongator subunit ELO3, essential for the mcm5 tRNA modification step, although we did not find XDH1 activity or tRNA thiolation to be markedly reduced in the grxs17-1 mutant. Taken together, our data suggest that plant cytosolic monothiol GRXs associate with the CIA complex, as in other eukaryotes, and contribute to, but are not essential for, the correct functioning of client Fe-S proteins in unchallenged conditions.",

First we showed that N-, but not C-terminal HA/FLAG tagging of Vpr protein preserves Vpr cytopathicity. Cloning the tags into proviral DNA however ablated viral production and replication. By construction of additional viral variants we could show this defect was not protein-but RNA-dependent and sequence specific, and characterized by oversplicing of the genomic RNA. Simulation of genomic RNA folding suggested that introduction of the tag sequence induced an alternative folding structure in a region enriched in splice sites and splicing regulatory sequences. In silico predictions identified the HA/His(6)-Vpr tagging in HIV-1 to affect mRNA folding less than HA/FLAG-Vpr tagging. In vitro infectivity and mRNA splice pattern improved but did not reach wild-type values. Thus, sequence-specific insertions may interfere with mRNA splicing, possibly due to altered RNA folding. Our results point to the complexity of viral RNA genome sequence interactions. This should be taken into consideration when designing viral manipulation strategies, for both research as for biological interventions.",

Systemic inflammation induced an increase in EVs and associated pro-inflammatory miRNAs, including miR-146a and miR-155, in the CSF. Interestingly, this was associated with an increase in amount of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and exosomes per MVB in the CPE cells. Additionally, we could mimic this using LPS-stimulated primary CPE cells and choroid plexus explants. These choroid plexus-derived EVs can enter the brain parenchyma and are taken up by astrocytes and microglia, inducing miRNA target repression and inflammatory gene up-regulation. Interestingly, this could be blocked in vivo by intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of an inhibitor of exosome production. Our data show that CPE cells sense and transmit information about the peripheral inflammatory status to the central nervous system (CNS) via the release of EVs into the CSF, which transfer this pro-inflammatory message to recipient brain cells. Additionally, we revealed that blockage of EV secretion decreases brain inflammation, which opens up new avenues to treat systemic inflammatory diseases such as sepsis.",

Finding the true positive interactors in these lists remains highly challenging. Here, we report a powerful design based on differential labeling with stable isotopes combined with nonequal mixing of control and experimental samples to discover bona fide interaction partners in AP-MS experiments. We apply this intelligent mixing of proteomes (iMixPro) concept to overexpression experiments for RAF1, RNF41, and TANK and also to engineered cell lines expressing epitope-tagged endogenous PTPN14, JIP3, and IQGAP1. For all baits, we confirmed known interactions and found a number of novel interactions.

The melanoma-specific oncogene MITF resides at the epicentre of this amplicon(1). However, whether other loci present in this amplicon also contribute to melanomagenesis is unknown. Here we show that the recently annotated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) gene SAMMSON is consistently co-gained with MITF. In addition, SAMMSON is a target of the lineage-specific transcription factor SOX10 and its expression is detectable in more than 90% of human melanomas. Whereas exogenous SAMMSON increases the clonogenic potential in trans, SAMMSON knockdown drastically decreases the viability of melanoma cells irrespective of their transcriptional cell state and BRAF, NRAS or TP53 mutational status. Moreover, SAMMSON targeting sensitizes melanoma to MAPK-targeting therapeutics both in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft models. Mechanistically, SAMMSON interacts with p32, a master regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolism, to increase its mitochondrial targeting and pro-oncogenic function. Our results indicate that silencing of the lineage addiction oncogene SAMMSON disrupts vital mitochondrial functions in a cancer-cell-specific manner; this silencing is therefore expected to deliver highly effective and tissue-restricted anti-melanoma therapeutic responses.",

Here, we used various complementary proteomic approaches to identify ACR4-interacting protein candidates that are likely regulators of formative cell divisions and that could pave the way to unraveling the molecular basis behind ACR4-mediated signaling. We identified PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A-3 (PP2A-3), a catalytic subunit of PP2A holoenzymes, as a previously unidentified regulator of formative cell divisions and as one of the first described substrates of ACR4.

However, numerous issues inherent to the mass spectrometry workflow turn quantitative proteomic data analysis into a crucial challenge. We and others have shown that modeling at the peptide level outperforms classical summarization-based approaches, which typically also discard a lot of proteins at the data preprocessing step. Peptide-based linear regression models, however, still suffer from unbalanced datasets due to missing peptide intensities, outlying peptide intensities and overfitting. Here, we further improve upon peptide-based models by three modular extensions: ridge regression, improved variance estimation by borrowing information across proteins with empirical Bayes and M-estimation with Huber weights. We illustrate our method on the CPTAC spike-in study and on a study comparing wild-type and ArgP knock-out Francisella tularensis proteomes. We show that the fold change estimates of our robust approach are more precise and more accurate than those from state-of-the-art summarization-based methods and peptide-based regression models, which leads to an improved sensitivity and specificity. We also demonstrate that ionization competition effects come already into play at very low spike-in concentrations and confirm that analyses with peptide-based regression methods on peptide intensity values aggregated by charge state and modification status (e.g. MaxQuant’s peptides.txt file) are slightly superior to analyses on raw peptide intensity values (e.g. MaxQuant’s evidence.txt file).",

By combining pulsed SILAC with N-terminal COFRADIC, we monitored the stability of 1,941 human N-terminal proteoforms, including 147N-terminal proteoform pairs that originate from alternative translation initiation, alternative splicing or incomplete processing of the initiator methionine. N-terminally truncated proteoforms were less abundant than canonical proteoforms and often displayed altered stabilities, likely attributed to individual protein characteristics, including intrinsic disorder, but independent of N-terminal amino acid identity or truncation length. We discovered that the removal of initiator methionine by methionine aminopeptidases reduced the stability of processed proteoforms, while susceptibility for N-terminal acetylation did not seem to influence protein turnover rates. Taken together, our findings reveal differences in protein stability between N-terminal proteoforms and point to a role for alternative translation initiation and co-translational initiator methionine removal, next to alternative splicing, in the overall regulation of proteome homeostasis.",

In particular, we examined if peptides encoding aggregation-prone sequence segments of bacterial proteins can display antimicrobial activity by initiating toxic protein aggregation in bacteria, but not in mammalian cells. Unbiased in vitro screening of aggregating peptide sequences from bacterial genomes lead to the identification of several peptides that are strongly bactericidal against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Upon parenteral administration in vivo, the peptides cured mice from bacterial sepsis without apparent toxic side effects as judged from histological and hematological evaluation. We found that the peptides enter and accumulate in the bacterial cytosol where they cause aggregation of bacterial polypeptides. Although the precise chain of events that leads to cell death remains to be elucidated, the ability to tap into aggregation-prone sequences of bacterial proteomes to elicit antimicrobial activity represents a rich and unexplored chemical space to be mined in search of novel therapeutic strategies to fight infectious diseases.",

Accordingly, GRXS17 is ubiquitinated and degraded in an RGLG3-and RGLG4-dependent manner in planta. The truncated hemoglobin GLB3 also interacted with RGLG3 and RGLG4 but appeared to obstruct RGLG3 ubiquitination activity rather than being its substrate.

Previous cross-study comparisons indicated how different types of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their subcellular accumulation sites are able to reshape the transcriptome in specific manners. However, these analyses often employed simplistic statistical frameworks that are not compatible with large-scale analyses. Here, we reanalyzed a total of 79 Affymetrix ATH1 microarray studies of redox homeostasis perturbation experiments. To create hierarchy in such a high number of transcriptomic data sets, all transcriptional profiles were clustered on the overlap extent of their differentially expressed transcripts. Subsequently, meta-analysis determined a single magnitude of differential expression across studies and identified common transcriptional footprints per cluster. The resulting transcriptional footprints revealed the regulation of various metabolic pathways and gene families. The RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG F-mediated respiratory burst had a major impact and was a converging point among several studies. Conversely, the timing of the oxidative stress response was a determining factor in shaping different transcriptome footprints. Our study emphasizes the need to interpret transcriptomic data sets in a systematic context, where initial, specific stress triggers can converge to common, aspecific transcriptional changes. We believe that these refined transcriptional footprints provide a valuable resource for assessing the involvement of ROS in biological processes in plants.",

Through large-scale, time-resolved, and quantitative proteomics, the impact of the strigolactone analog rac-GR24 was elucidated on the root proteome of the wild type and the signaling mutant more axillary growth 2 (max2). Our study revealed a clear MAX2-dependent rac-GR24 response: an increase in abundance of enzymes involved in flavonol biosynthesis, which was reduced in the max2-1 mutant. Mass spectrometry-driven metabolite profiling and thin-layer chromatography experiments demonstrated that these changes in protein expression lead to the accumulation of specific flavonols. Moreover, quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the flavonol-related protein expression profile was caused by rac-GR24-induced changes in transcript levels of the corresponding genes. This induction of flavonol production was shown to be activated by the two pure enantiomers that together make up rac-GR24. Finally, our data provide much needed clues concerning the multiple roles played by MAX2 in the roots and a comprehensive view of the rac-GR24-induced response in the root proteome.",

Capturing in vivo protein complexes is therefore crucial to gain understanding of the function of a protein in a cellular context. Affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry has proven to yield a wealth of information about protein complex constitutions for a broad range of organisms. For Oryza sativa, the technique has been initiated in callus and shoots, but has not been optimized ever since. We translated an optimized tandem affinity purification (TAP) approach from Arabidopsis thaliana toward Oryza sativa, and demonstrate its applicability in a variety of rice tissues. A list of non-specific and false positive interactors is presented, based on re-occurrence over more than 170 independent experiments, to filter bona fide interactors. We demonstrate the sensitivity of our approach by isolating the complexes for the rice ANAPHASE PROMOTING COMPLEX SUBUNIT 10 (APC10) and CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE D (CDKD) proteins from the proliferation zone of the emerging fourth leaf. Next to APC10 and CDKD, we tested several additional baits in the different rice tissues and reproducibly retrieved at least one interactor for 81.4 % of the baits screened for in callus tissue and T1 seedlings. By transferring an optimized TAP tag combined with state-of-the-art mass spectrometry, our TAP protocol enables the discovery of interactors for low abundance proteins in rice and opens the possibility to capture complex dynamics by comparing tissues at different stages of a developing rice organ.",

Here, we present a simple workflow to probe, map, and catalogue plant phosphoproteomes, requiring relatively low amounts of starting material, no labeling, no fractionation, and no excessive analysis time. Following optimization of the different experimental steps on Arabidopsis thaliana samples, we transferred our workflow to maize, a major monocot crop, to study signaling upon drought stress. In addition, we included normalization to protein abundance to identify true phosphorylation changes. Overall, we identified a set of new phosphosites in both Arabidopsis thaliana and maize, some of which are differentially phosphorylated upon drought.

In contrast, in zebrafish three type I collagen genes exist, col1a1a, col1a1b and col1a2 coding for alpha 1(I), alpha 3(I) and alpha 2(I) chains. During embryonic and larval development the three collagen type I genes showed a similar spatio-temporal expression pattern, indicating their co-regulation and interdependence at these stages. In both embryonic and adult tissues, the presence of the three a(I) chains was demonstrated, although in embryos alpha 1(I) was present in two distinct glycosylated states, suggesting a developmental-specific collagen composition. Even though in adult bone, skin and scales equal amounts of alpha 1(I), alpha 3(I) and alpha 2(I) chains are present, the presented data suggest a tissue-specific stoichiometry and/or post-translational modification status for collagen type I.

The CRINKLY4 (CR4) family of receptor-like kinases is involved in a wide range of developmental processes in plants, including mediating columella stem cell identity and differentiation in the Arabidopsis thaliana root tip. Members of the CR4 family contain a signal peptide, an extracellular part, a single-pass transmembrane helix and an intracellular cytoplasmic protein kinase domain. The main distinguishing features of the family are the presence of seven \"crinkly\" repeats and a TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR RECEPTOR (TNER)-like domain in the extracellular part. Here, we investigated the evolutionary origin of the CR4 family and explored to what extent members of this family are conserved throughout the green lineage. We identified members of the CR4 family in various dicots and monocots, and also in the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii and the bryophyte Physcomitrella patens. In addition, we attempted to gain insight in the evolutionary origin of different CR4-specific domains, and we could detect \"crinkly\" repeat containing proteins already in single celled algae. Finally, we related the presence of likely functional CR4 orthologs to its best described signaling module comprising CLAVATA3/EMBRY0 SURROUNDING REGION-RELATED 40 (CLE40), WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX 5 (W0X5), CLAVATA 1 (CLV1), and ARABIDOPSIS CR4 (ACR4), and established that this module likely is already present in bryophytes and lycophytes.",

Accordingly, kix8 kix9 mutants phenocopied PPD loss-of-function producing larger leaves resulting from increased meristemoid amplifying divisions.

The bait protein is fused to a double affinity tag, which consists of a protein G tag and a streptavidin-binding peptide separated by a very specific protease cleavage site, allowing highly specific protein complex isolation under near-physiological conditions. Implementation of this optimized TAP tag, combined with ultrasensitive MS, means that these experiments can be performed on small amounts (25 mg of total protein) of protein extracts from Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures. It is also possible to use this approach to isolate low abundant protein complexes from Arabidopsis seedlings, thus opening perspectives for the exploration of protein complexes in a plant developmental context. Next to protocols for efficient biomass generation of seedlings (similar to 7.5 months), we provide detailed protocols for TAP (1 d), and for sample preparation and liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS; similar to 5 d), either from Arabidopsis seedlings or from cell cultures. For the identification of specific co-purifying proteins, we use an extended protein database and filter against a list of nonspecific proteins on the basis of the occurrence of a co-purified protein among 543 TAP experiments.

A new membrane topology assay named PROMPT and a selective membrane permeabilization assay established that Naa60 faces the cytosolic side of intracellular membranes. An Nt-acetylome analysis of NAA60-knockdown cells revealed that Naa60, as opposed to other NATs, specifically acetylates transmembrane proteins and has a preference for N termini facing the cytosol. Moreover, NAA60 knockdown causes Golgi fragmentation, indicating an important role in the maintenance of the Golgi's structural integrity.

Structural models and molecular dynamics simulations of the human NatA and its S37P mutant highlight differences in regions involved in catalysis and at the interface between Naa10 and the auxiliary subunit hNaa15. Biochemical data further demonstrate a reduced catalytic capacity and an impaired interaction between hNaa10 S37P and Naa15 as well as Naa50 (NatE), another interactor of the NatA complex. N-Terminal acetylome analyses revealed a decreased acetylation of a subset of NatA and NatE substrates in Ogden syndrome cells, supporting the genetic findings and our hypothesis regarding reduced Nt-acetylation of a subset of NatA/NatE-type substrates as one etiology for Ogden syndrome. Furthermore, Ogden syndrome fibroblasts display abnormal cell migration and proliferation capacity, possibly linked to a perturbed retinoblastoma pathway.

By means of C-terminal COFRADIC, a positional proteomics approach, we searched for cellular substrates targets of CCP1, the most relevant member of this family. We here identified seven new putative CCP1 protein substrates, including ribosomal proteins, translation factors, and high mobility group proteins.

During the course of evolution, plants have adapted to ROS toxicity, and use ROS as signalling messengers that activate defence responses. Cysteine (Cys) residues in proteins are one of the most sensitive targets for ROS-mediated post-translational modifications, and they have become key residues for ROS signalling studies. The reactivity of Cys residues towards ROS, and their ability to react to different oxidation states, allow them to appear at the crossroads of highly dynamic oxidative events. As such, a redox-active cysteine can be present as S-glutathionylated (-SSG), disulfide bonded (S-S), sulfenylated (-SOH), sulfinylated (-SO2H), and sulfonylated (-SO3H). The sulfenic acid (-SOH) form has been considered as part of ROS-sensing pathways, as it leads to further modifications which affect protein structure and function. Redox proteomic studies are required to understand how and why cysteines undergo oxidative post-translational modifications and to identify the ROS-sensor proteins. Here, we update current knowledge of cysteine reactivity with ROS. Further, we give an overview of proteomic techniques that have been applied to identify different redox-modified cysteines in plants. There is a particular focus on the identification of sulfenylated proteins, which have the potential to be involved in plant signal transduction.",

Our results indicate that the growth-regulating SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex associated with ANGUSTIFOLIA3 (AN3) was conserved within growing organs and between dicots and monocots. Moreover, we were able to demonstrate the dynamics of the AN3-interacting proteins within the growing leaf, since copurified GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORs (GRFs) varied throughout the growing leaf. Indeed, GRF1, GRF6, GRF7, GRF12, GRF15, and GRF17 were significantly enriched in the division zone of the growing leaf, while GRF4 and GRF10 levels were comparable between division zone and expansion zone in the growing leaf. These dynamics were also reflected at the mRNA and protein levels, indicating tight developmental regulation of the AN3-associated chromatin remodeling complex. In addition, the phenotypes of maize plants overexpressing miRNA396a-resistant GRF1 support a model proposing that distinct associations of the chromatin remodeling complex with specific GRFs tightly regulate the transition between cell division and cell expansion.

Reliable determination of a protease's specificity is crucial to understand protease function and to develop activity-based probes and inhibitors. During the last decade, various proteomic approaches for profiling protease substrate specificities were reported. Although most of these approaches can identify up to thousands of substrate cleavage events in a single experiment, they are often time consuming and methodologically challenging as some of these approaches require rather complex sample preparation procedures. For such reasons their application is often limited to those labs that initially introduced them. Here, we report on a fast and simple approach for proteomic profiling of protease specificities (fast profiling of protease specificity (FPPS)), which can be applied to complex protein mixtures. FPPS is based on trideutero-acetylation of novel N-termini generated by the action of proteases and subsequent peptide fractionation on Stage Tips containing ion-exchange and reverse phase chromatographic resins. FPPS can be performed in 2 days and does not require extensive fractionation steps. Using this approach, we have determined the specificity profiles of the cysteine cathepsins K, L and S. We further validated our method by comparing the results with the specificity profiles obtained by the N-terminal combined fractional diagonal chromatography method. This comparison pointed to almost identical substrate specificities for all three cathepsins and confirmed the reliability of the FPPS approach.

Flies harbor only one Lrrk gene, which might encompass the functions of both mammalian LRRK1 and LRRK2. We therefore studied the role of LRRK2 in mammalian synaptic function and provide evidence that knockout or pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 results in defects in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, altered synaptic morphology and impairments in neurotransmission. In addition, our data indicate that mammalian endophilin A1 (EndoA1, also known as SH3GL2) is phosphorylated by LRRK2 in vitro at T73 and S75, two residues in the BAR domain. Hence, our results indicate that LRRK2 kinase activity has an important role in the regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles and subsequent neurotransmission at the synapse.",

We combined limited proteolysis with stable isotope labeling MS to monitor protein conformational changes upon binding of small molecules. Applying this method to the human serine/threonine kinase B-Raf, frequently mutated in cancer, we found that binding of ATP or its nonhydrolyzable analogue AMP-PNP, but not ADP, stabilized the structure of both B-Raf(WT) and B-Raf(V600E) The ATP-competitive type I B-Raf inhibitor vemurafenib and the type II inhibitor sorafenib stabilized the kinase domain (KD) but had distinct effects on the Ras-binding domain. Stabilization of the B-Raf(WT) KD was confirmed by hydrogen/deuterium exchange MS and molecular dynamics simulations. Our results are further supported by cellular assays in which we assessed cell viability and phosphorylation profiles in cells expressing B-Raf(WT) or B-Raf(V600E) in response to vemurafenib or sorafenib. Our data indicate that an overall stabilization of the B-Raf structure by specific inhibitors activates MAPK signaling and increases cell survival, helping to explain clinical treatment failure. We also applied our method to monitor conformational changes upon nucleotide binding of the pseudokinase KSR1, which holds high potential for inhibition in human diseases.",

            "abstract": "Meiotic crossovers (COs) have two important roles, shuffling genetic information and ensuring proper chromosome segregation. Despite their importance and a large excess of precursors (i.e., DNA doublestrand breaks, DSBs), the number of COs is tightly regulated, typically one to three per chromosome pair. The mechanisms ensuring that most DSBs are repaired as non-COs and the evolutionary forces imposing this constraint are poorly understood. Here we identified Topoisomerase3 alpha (TOP3 alpha) and the RECQ4 helicases-the Arabidopsis slow growth suppressor 1 (Sgs1)/Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) homologs-as major barriers to meiotic CO formation. First, the characterization of a specific TOP3 alpha mutant allele revealed that, in addition to its role in DNA repair, this topoisomerase antagonizes CO formation. Further, we found that RECQ4A and RECQ4B constitute the strongest meiotic anti-CO activity identified to date, their concomitant depletion leading to a sixfold increase in CO frequency. In both top3 alpha and recq4ab mutants, DSB number is unaffected, and extra COs arise from a normally minor pathway. Finally, both TOP3 alpha and RECQ4A/B act independently of the previously identified anti-CO Fanconi anemia of complementation group M (FANCM) helicase. This finding shows that several parallel pathways actively limit CO formation and suggests that the RECQA/B and FANCM helicases prevent COs by processing different substrates. Despite a ninefold increase in CO frequency, chromosome segregation was unaffected. This finding supports the idea that CO number is restricted not because of mechanical constraints but likely because of the long-term costs of recombination. Furthermore, this work demonstrates how manipulating a few genes holds great promise for increasing recombination frequency in plant-breeding programs.",

The very N-terminal amino acid sequence largely determines whether or not a given protein is Nt-acetylated. Currently, there are six distinct NATs characterized, NatA-NatF, in humans of which the in vivo substrate specificity of Naa50 (Nat5)/NatE, an alternative catalytic subunit of the human NatA, so far remained elusive. In this study, we quantitatively compared the Nt-acetylomes of wild-type yeast S. cerevisiae expressing the endogenous yeast Naa50 (yNaa50), the congenic strain lacking yNaa50, and an otherwise identical strain expressing human Naa50 (hNaa50). Six canonical yeast NatA substrates were Nt-acetylated less in yeast lacking yNaa50 than in wild-type yeast. In contrast, the ectopically expressed hNaa50 resulted, predominantly, in the Nt-acetylation of N-terminal Met (iMet) starting N-termini, including iMet-Lys, iMet-Val, iMet-Ala, iMet-Tyr, iMet-Phe, iMet-Leu, iMet-Ser, and iMet-Thr N-termini. This identified hNaa50 as being similar, in its substrate specificity, to the previously characterized hNaa60/NatF. In addition, the identification, in yNaa50-lacking yeast expressing hNaa50, of Nt-acetylated iMet followed by a small residue such as Ser, Thr, Ala, or Val, revealed a kinetic competition between Naa50 and Met-aminopeptidases (MetAPs), and implied that Nt-acetylated iMet followed by a small residue cannot be removed by MetAPs, a deduction supported by our in vitro data. As such, Naa50-mediated Nt-acetylation may act to retain the iMet of proteins of otherwise MetAP susceptible N-termini and the fraction of retained and Nt-acetylated iMet (followed by a small residue) in such a setting would be expected to depend on the relative levels of ribosome-associated Naa50/NatA and MetAPs.",

Considering this genetic defect and the frequent genomic alterations of the NBPF1 locus in several cancer types, we hypothesized that NBPF1 is a tumor suppressor. Decreased expression of NBPF1 in neuroblastoma cell lines with loss of 1p36 heterozygosity and the marked decrease of anchorage-independent clonal growth of DLD1 colorectal carcinoma cells with induced NBPF1 expression further suggest that NBPF1 functions as tumor suppressor. However, little is known about the mechanisms involved. \r\nMethods: Expression of NBPF was analyzed in human skin and human cervix by immunohistochemistry. The effects of NBPF1 on the cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry. We investigated by real-time quantitative RT-PCR the expression profile of a panel of genes important in cell cycle regulation. Protein levels of CDKN1A-encoded p21(CIP1/WAF1) were determined by western blotting and the importance of p53 was shown by immunofluorescence and by a loss-offunction approach. LC-MS/MS analysis was used to investigate the proteome of DLD1 colon cancer cells with induced NBPF1 expression. Possible biological interactions between the differentially regulated proteins were investigated with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool. \r\nResults: We show that NBPF is expressed in the non-proliferative suprabasal layers of squamous stratified epithelia of human skin and cervix. Forced expression of NBPF1 in HEK293T cells resulted in a G1 cell cycle arrest that was accompanied by upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(CIP1/WAF1) in a p53-dependent manner. Additionally, forced expression of NBPF1 in two p53-mutant neuroblastoma cell lines also resulted in a G1 cell cycle arrest and CDKN1A upregulation. However, CDKN1A upregulation by NBPF1 was not observed in the DLD1 cells, which demonstrates that NBPF1 exerts cell-specific effects. In addition, proteome analysis of NBPF1-overexpressing DLD1 cells identified 32 differentially expressed proteins, of which several are implicated in carcinogenesis. \r\nConclusions: We demonstrated that NBPF1 exerts different tumor suppressive effects, depending on the cell line analyzed, and provide new clues into the molecular mechanism of the enigmatic NBPF proteins.",

Therefore, mass spectrometry-based approaches, such as limited proteolysis, hydrogen-deuterium exchange, and stable-isotope labeling, are frequently used to characterize protein conformation and dynamics, yet the interpretation of these data can be cumbersome and time consuming. Here, we present PepShell, a tool that allows interactive data analysis of mass spectrometry-based conformational proteomics studies by visualization of the identified peptides both at the sequence and structure levels.

This typically leads to conformational changes in the receptor, thereby modifying its spectrum of interaction partners. Next, secondary signals are transmitted via rapid post-translational cascades, such as targeted phosphorylation or ubiquitination, resulting in the activation/deactivation, relocalization or degradation of target proteins. These events finally give rise to the signal-dependent read-out, such as changes in gene expression and regulation of protein activity. So far, the majority of studies aimed at unravelling hormone signalling pathways in plants relied on genetic or transcriptomic approaches. During the last decade however, MS-driven proteomic methods became increasingly popular tools in plant research as they reveal the specific mechanisms controlled by phytohormones, which for a large part occur on the level of the proteome. Here, we provide an up-to-date review on the growing body of work in these areas using MS-based techniques, with a focus on nonpeptide plant hormones.",

Identification of proteins with oxidized methionines is the first prerequisite toward understanding the functional effect of methionine oxidation on proteins and the biological processes in which they are involved. Here, we describe a proteome-wide study of in vivo protein-bound methionine oxidation in plants upon oxidative stress using Arabidopsis thaliana catalase 2 knock-out plants as a model system. We identified over 500 sites of oxidation in about 400 proteins and quantified the differences in oxidation between wild-type and catalase 2 knock-out plants. We show that the activity of two plant-specific glutathione S-transferases, GSTF9 and GSTT23, is significantly reduced upon oxidation. And, by sampling over time, we mapped the dynamics of methionine oxidation and gained new insights into this complex and dynamic landscape of a part of the plant proteome that is sculpted by oxidative stress.",

In the present study, we compared wildtype (WT) Synechocystis cells with the single insertion mutants Delta hhoA, Delta hhoB and Delta htrA. Protein expression of the remaining Deg/HtrA proteases was strongly affected in the single insertion mutants. Detailed proteomic studies using DIGE (difference gel electrophoresis) and N-terminal COFRADIC (N-terminal combined fractional diagonal chromatography) revealed that inactivation of a single Deg protease has similar impact on the proteomes of the three mutants; differences to WT were observed in enzymes involved in the major metabolic pathways. Changes in the amount of phosphate permease system Pst-1 were observed only in the insertion mutant Delta hhoB. N-terminal COFRADIC analyses on cell lysates of Delta hhoB confirmed changed amounts of many cell envelope proteins, including the phosphate permease systems, compared with WT. In vitro COFRADIC studies were performed to identify the specificity profiles of the recombinant proteases rHhoA, rHhoB or rHtrA added to the Synechocystis WT proteome. The combined in vivo and in vitro N-terminal COFRADIC datasets propose RbcS as a natural substrate for HhoA, PsbO for HhoB and HtrA and Pbp8 for HtrA. We therefore suggest that each Synechocystis Deg protease protects the cell through different, but connected mechanisms.",

One of the major mechanisms used by other extracellular proteases to facilitate cancer progression is proteolytic release of the extracellular domains of transmembrane proteins or ectodomain shedding. Here we show using a mass spectrometry-based approach that cathepsins L and S act as sheddases and cleave extracellular domains of CAM adhesion proteins and transmembrane receptors from the surface of cancer cells. In cathepsin S-deficient mouse pancreatic cancers, processing of these cathepsin substrates is highly reduced, pointing to an essential role of cathepsins in extracellular shedding. In addition to influencing cell migration and invasion, shedding of surface proteins by extracellular cathepsins impacts intracellular signaling as demonstrated for regulation of Ras GTPase activity, thereby providing a putative mechanistic link between extracellular cathepsin activity and cancer progression.

A new class of inhibitors (paradox breakers) has been developed that inhibit B-RafV600E activity without agonistically affecting the MAPK pathway in wild-type B-Raf cells. In this study, we explore the structural, conformational, and cellular effects on the B-Raf kinase domain upon binding of paradox breakers and inducers. Our results indicate that a subtle structural difference between paradox inducers and breakers leads to significant conformational differences when complexed with B-Raf.

Two proteomic approaches, gel electrophoresis with mass spectrometry and combined fractional diagonal chromatography (COFRADIC), were performed using tissue samples from the periphery of the induced cerebral ischemic lesions, using tissue from the contra-lateral hemisphere as a control. Several protein spots (3408) were identified by gel electrophoresis, and 11 showed significant differences in expression between peri-infarct and contralateral tissues (at least 3-fold, p < 0.05). Using COFRADIC, 5412 proteins were identified, with 72 showing a difference in expression. Apart from blood-related proteins (such as serum albumin), both techniques showed that the 70 kDa family of heat shock proteins were highly expressed in the peri-infarct tissue. Further studies by 1D and 2D western blotting and immunohistochemistry revealed that only one member of this family (the inducible form, HSP72 or HSP70i) is specifically expressed by the peri-infarct tissue, while the majority of this family (the constitutive form, HSC70 or HSP70c) is expressed in the whole brain.

In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the JAZ family consists of 13 members. The level of redundancy or specificity among these members is currently not well understood. Here, we characterized JAZ12, encoded by a highly expressed JAZ gene. JAZ12 interacted with the transcription factors MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4 in vivo and repressed MYC2 activity. Using tandem affinity purification, we found JAZ12 to interact with SCFCOI1 components, matching with observed in vivo ubiquitination and with rapid degradation after treatment with JA. In contrast to the other JAZ proteins, JAZ12 also interacted directly with the E3 RING ligase KEEP ON GOING (KEG), a known repressor of the ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE5 transcription factor in abscisic acid signaling. To study the functional role of this interaction, we circumvented the lethality of keg loss-of-function mutants by silencing KEG using an artificial microRNA approach. Abscisic acid treatment promoted JAZ12 degradation, and KEG knockdown led to a decrease in JAZ12 protein levels. Correspondingly, KEG overexpression was capable of partially inhibiting COI1-mediated JAZ12 degradation. Our results provide additional evidence for KEG as an important factor in plant hormone signaling and a positive regulator of JAZ12 stability.",

Antigen cross-presentation by non-activated DCs, however, is not sufficient for the effective induction of immune responses. Additionally, DCs need to be activated through innate receptors, like Toll-like receptors (TLRs). During DC maturation, cross-presentation efficiency is first upregulated and then turned off. Here we show that during this transient phase of enhanced cross-presentation, phago-lysosome fusion was blocked by the topological re-organization of lysosomes into perinuclear clusters. LPS-induced lysosomal clustering, inhibition of phago-lysosome fusion and enhanced cross-presentation, all required expression of the GTPase Rab34.

Incremental changes in the number of repeats in the yeast transcriptional regulator Ssn6 (Cyc8) result in systematic, repeat-length-dependent variation in expression of target genes that result in direct phenotypic changes. The function of Ssn6 increases with its repeat number until a certain threshold where further expansion leads to aggregation. Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals that the Ssn6 repeats affect its solubility and interactions with Tup1 and other regulators. Thus, Q-rich repeats are dynamic functional domains that modulate a regulator's innate function, with the inherent risk of pathogenic repeat expansions.",

Using single -cell, spatial multi-omics, we showed that the tumor microenvironment promotes the emergence of a complex melanoma transcriptomic landscape. Melanoma cells harboring a mesenchymal-like (MES) state, a population known to confer resistance to targeted therapy, were significantly enriched in early on -treatment biopsies from non -responders to ICB. TCF4 serves as the hub of this landscape by being a master regulator of the MES signature and a suppressor of the melanocytic and antigen presentation transcriptional programs. Targeting TCF4 genetically or pharmacologically, using a bromodomain inhibitor, increased immunogenicity and sensitivity of MES cells to ICB and targeted therapy. We thereby uncovered a TCF4-dependent regulatory network that orchestrates multiple transcriptional programs and contributes to resistance to both targeted therapy and ICB in melanoma.",

Adjuvanted vaccine development relies on a holistic understanding of how adjuvants modulate the quantity/titer and quality of the antibody response.\n\nMethods: A Phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00805389) evaluated hepatitis B vaccines formulated with licensed adjuvants (AS01B, AS01E, AS03, AS04 or Alum) in antigen-naïve adults. The trial investigated the role of adjuvants in shaping antibody-effector functions, and identified an innate transcriptional response shared by AS01B, AS01E and AS03. We integrated previously reported data on the innate response (gene expression, cytokine/C-reactive protein levels) and on quantitative/qualitative features of the mature antibody response (Fc-related parameters, immunoglobulin titers, avidity). Associations between the innate and humoral parameters were explored using systems vaccinology and a machine-learning framework.\n\nResults: A dichotomy in responses between AS01/AS03 and AS04/Alum (with the former two contributing most to the association with the humoral response) was observed across all timepoints of this longitudinal study. The consistent patterns over time suggested a similarity in the impacts of the two-dose immunization regimen, year-long interval, and non-adjuvanted antigenic challenge given one year later. An innate signature characterized by interferon pathway-related gene expression and secreted interferon-γ-induced protein 10 and C-reactive protein, which was shared by AS01 and AS03, consistently predicted both the qualitative antibody response features and the titers. The signature also predicted from the antibody response quality, the group of adjuvants from which the administered vaccine was derived.\n\nConclusion: An innate signature induced by AS01- or AS03-adjuvanted vaccines predicts the antibody response magnitude and quality consistently over time.",

However, deep learning systems are extremely fragile: imperceptibly small modifications to their input data can cause the models to produce erroneous output. It is very easy to generate such adversarial perturbations even for state-of-the-art models, yet immunization against them has proven exceptionally challenging. Despite over a decade of research on this problem, our solutions are still far from satisfactory and many open problems remain. In this work, we survey some of the most important contributions in the fi eld of adversarial robustness.

Despite a recent growth in popularity and available methods, the objective evaluation of such attribution maps remains an open problem. Building on previous work in this domain, we investigate existing quality metrics and propose new variants of metrics for the evaluation of attribution maps. We confirm a recent finding that different quality metrics seem to measure different underlying properties of attribution maps, and extend this finding to a larger selection of attribution methods, quality metrics, and datasets. We also find that metric results on one dataset do not necessarily generalize to other datasets, and methods with desirable theoretical properties do not necessarily outperform computationally cheaper alternatives in practice. Based on these findings, we propose a general benchmarking approach to help guide the selection of attribution methods for a given use case. Implementations of attribution metrics and our experiments are available online (https://github.com/arnegevaert/benchmark-general-imaging).",

Considering the diverse environmental conditions throughout the course of the small intestine, multiple subtypes of PCs are expected to exist. We applied single-cell RNA-sequencing of PCs combined with deep bulk RNA-sequencing on PC populations of different small intestinal locations and discovered several expression-based PC clusters. Some of these are discrete and resemble tuft cell-like PCs, goblet cell (GC)-like PCs, PCs expressing stem cell markers, and atypical PCs. Other clusters are less discrete but appear to be derived from different locations along the intestinal tract and have environment-dictated functions such as food digestion and antimicrobial peptide production. A comprehensive spatial analysis using Resolve Bioscience was conducted, leading to the identification of different PC's transcriptomic identities along the different compartments of the intestine, but not between PCs in the crypts themselves.",

In some cases, users may have prior knowledge of the topology of the data, such as a known cluster structure or the fact that it follows a tree- or graph-based structure. However, generic methods for ensuring this inherent structure is evident in low-dimensional representations are lacking and it is unknown how imposing topological constraints affects downstream learning tasks. To fill this gap, we propose topological regularization - a generic approach based on algebraic topology to incorporate topological prior knowledge into low-dimensional representations. We introduce a class of topological loss functions and demonstrate that optimizing an embedding loss together with one of these loss functions as a regularizer results in embeddings that consider not only local proximities but also the desired topological structure. We provide a self-contained introduction to essential concepts in algebraic topology and offer intuitive guidance for designing topological loss functions suitable for a variety of data shapes, such as clusters, cycles, or bifurcations. We empirically assess the efficiency, robustness, and versatility of the proposed method when combined with linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques, as well as graph embedding methods.",

Myelodysplastic neoplasms are notorious for their heterogeneity: clinical outcomes range from a near-normal life expectancy to leukaemic transformation or premature death due to cytopenia. The Molecular International Prognostic Scoring System made progress in the dissection of MDS by clinical outcomes. To contribute to the risk stratification of MDS by immunophenotypic profiles, this study performed computational clustering of flow cytometry data of CD34+ cells in 67 MDS, 67 AML patients and 49 controls. Our data revealed heterogeneity also within the MDS-derived CD34+ compartment. In MDS, maintenance of lymphoid progenitors and megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitors predicted favourable outcomes, whereas expansion of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors increased the risk of leukaemic transformation. The proliferation of haematopoietic stem cells and common myeloid progenitors with downregulated CD44 expression, suggestive of impaired haematopoietic differentiation, characterised a distinct MDS subtype with a poor overall survival. This exploratory study demonstrates the prognostic value of known and previously unexplored CD34+ populations and suggests the feasibility of dissecting MDS into a more indolent, a leukaemic and another unfavourable subtype.",

Since most commercial untargeted ST technologies do not yet operate at single-cell resolution, computational methods such as deconvolution are often used to infer the cell type composition of each sequenced spot. We benchmarked 11 deconvolution methods using 63 silver standards, 3 gold standards, and 2 case studies on liver and melanoma tissues. We developed a simulation engine called synthspot to generate silver standards from single-cell RNA-sequencing data, while gold standards are generated by pooling single cells from targeted ST data. We evaluated methods based on their performance, stability across different reference datasets, and scalability. We found that cell2location and RCTD are the top-performing methods, but surprisingly, a simple regression model outperforms almost half of the dedicated spatial deconvolution methods. Furthermore, we observe that the performance of all methods significantly decreased in datasets with highly abundant or rare cell types. Our results are reproducible in a Nextflow pipeline, which also allows users to generate synthetic data, run deconvolution methods and optionally benchmark them on their dataset (https://github.com/saeyslab/spotless-benchmark).",

            "abstract": "Motivation Automatic cell type annotation methods assign cell type labels to new datasets by extracting relationships from a reference RNA-seq dataset. However, due to the limited resolution of gene expression features, there is always uncertainty present in the label assignment. To enhance the reliability and robustness of annotation, most machine learning methods address this uncertainty by providing a full reject option, i.e. when the predicted confidence score of a cell type label falls below a user-defined threshold, no label is assigned and no prediction is made. As a better alternative, some methods deploy hierarchical models and consider a so-called partial rejection by returning internal nodes of the hierarchy as label assignment. However, because a detailed experimental analysis of various rejection approaches is missing in the literature, there is currently no consensus on best practices.Results We evaluate three annotation approaches (i) full rejection, (ii) partial rejection, and (iii) no rejection for both flat and hierarchical probabilistic classifiers. Our findings indicate that hierarchical classifiers are superior when rejection is applied, with partial rejection being the preferred rejection approach, as it preserves a significant amount of label information. For optimal rejection implementation, the rejection threshold should be determined through careful examination of a method's rejection behavior. Without rejection, flat and hierarchical annotation perform equally well, as long as the cell type hierarchy accurately captures transcriptomic relationships.Availability and implementation Code is freely available at https://github.com/Latheuni/Hierarchical_reject and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10697468.",

In this study, we show that local delivery of a bispecific Clec9A-PD-L1 targeted type I interferon (AcTaferon, AFN) overcomes this hurdle by reshaping the tumor immune landscape.\n\nTreatment with the bispecific AFN resulted in the presence of pro-immunogenic tumor-associated macrophages and neutrophils, increased motility and maturation profile of cDC1 and presence of inflammatory cDC2. Moreover, we report empowered diversity in the CD8+ T cell repertoire and induction of a shift from naive, dysfunctional CD8+ T cells towards effector, plastic cytotoxic T lymphocytes together with increased presence of NK and NKT cells as well as decreased regulatory T cell levels. These dynamic changes were associated with potent antitumor activity. Tumor clearance and immunological memory, therapeutic immunity on large established tumors and blunted tumor growth at distant sites were obtained upon co-administration of a non-curative dose of chemotherapy.\n\nOverall, this study illuminates further application of type I interferon as a safe and efficient way to reshape the suppressive tumor microenvironment and induce potent antitumor immunity; features which are of major importance in overcoming the development of metastases and tumor cell resistance to immune attack.

However, the mechanisms determining their cell-specific expression remain unknown. Here we describe the transcriptional regulatory network that underlies cell-specific biosynthesis of triterpenes in Arabidopsis thaliana root tips. Expression of thalianol and marneral biosynthesis pathway genes depends on the phytohormone jasmonate and is limited to outer tissues.

Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) improves survival outcomes, but recurrence rates remain high. Dendritic cell-based immunotherapy (DCBI) showed promising results in patients with pleural mesothelioma. The primary aim of this trial was to determine feasibility of adjuvant DCBI after CRS-HIPEC.\n\nMethods: This open-label, single-center, phase II clinical trial, performed in the Erasmus MC Cancer Institute Rotterdam, the Netherlands, included patients with epithelioid MPM. 4-6 weeks before CRS-HIPEC leukapheresis was performed. 8-10 weeks after surgery, DCBI was administered three times biweekly. Feasibility was defined as administration of at least three adjuvant vaccinations in 75% of patients. Comprehensive immune cell profiling was performed on peripheral blood samples prior to and during treatment.\n\nResults: All patients who received CRS-HIPEC (n=16) were successfully treated with adjuvant DCBI. No severe toxicity related to DCBI was observed. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12 months (IQR 5-23) and median overall survival was not reached. DCBI was associated with increased proliferation of circulating natural killer cells and CD4+ T-helper (Th) cells. Co-stimulatory molecules, including ICOS, HLA-DR, and CD28 were upregulated predominantly on memory or proliferating Th-cells and minimally on CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) after treatment. However, an increase in CD8+ terminally differentiated effector memory (Temra) cells positively correlated with PFS, whereas co-expression of ICOS and Ki67 on CTLs trended towards a positive correlation.\n\nConclusions: Adjuvant DCBI after CRS-HIPEC in patients with MPM was feasible and safe, and showed promising survival outcomes. DCBI had an immune modulatory effect on lymphoid cells and induced memory T-cell activation. Moreover, an increase of CD8+ Temra cells was more pronounced in patients with longer PFS. These data provide rationale for future combination treatment strategies.",

            "abstract": "In Arabidopsis thaliana, brassinosteroid (BR) signaling and stomatal development are connected through the SHAGGY/GSK3-like kinase BR INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2). BIN2 is a key negative regulator of BR signaling but it plays a dual role in stomatal development. BIN2 promotes or restricts stomatal asymmetric cell division (ACD) depending on its subcellular localization, which is regulated by the stomatal lineage-specific scaffold protein POLAR. BRs inactivate BIN2, but how they govern stomatal development remains unclear. Mapping the single-cell transcriptome of stomatal lineages after triggering BR signaling with either exogenous BRs or the specific BIN2 inhibitor, bikinin, revealed that the two modes of BR signaling activation generate spatiotemporally distinct transcriptional responses. We established that BIN2 is always sensitive to the inhibitor but, when in a complex with POLAR and its closest homolog POLAR-LIKE1, it becomes protected from BR-mediated inactivation. Subsequently, BR signaling in ACD precursors is attenuated, while it remains active in epidermal cells devoid of scaffolds and undergoing differentiation. Our study demonstrates how scaffold proteins contribute to cellular signal specificity of hormonal responses in plants.",

Ferroptosis and pyroptosis are two detrimental forms of regulated cell death that could constitute new therapeutic targets. We enrolled 120 critical COVID-19 patients in a two-center prospective cohort study to monitor systemic markers of ferroptosis, iron dyshomeostasis, pyroptosis, pneumocyte cell death and cell damage on the first three consecutive days after ICU admission. Plasma of 20 post-operative ICU patients (PO) and 39 healthy controls (HC) without organ failure served as controls. Subsets of COVID-19 patients displayed increases in individual biomarkers compared to controls. Unsupervised clustering was used to discern latent clusters of COVID-19 patients based on biomarker profiles. Pyroptosis-related interleukin-18 accompanied by high pneumocyte cell death was independently associated with higher odds at mechanical ventilation, while the subgroup with high interleuking-1 beta (but limited pneumocyte cell death) displayed reduced odds at mechanical ventilation and lower mortality hazard. Meanwhile, iron dyshomeostasis with a tendency towards higher ferroptosis marker malondialdehyde had no association with outcome, except for the small subset of patients with very high catalytic iron independently associated with reduced survival. Forty percent of patients did not have a clear signature of the cell death mechanisms studied in this cohort. Moreover, repeated moderate levels of soluble receptor of advanced glycation end products and growth differentiation factor 15 during the first three days after ICU admission are independently associated with adverse clinical outcome compared to sustained lower levels. Altogether, the data point towards distinct subgroups in this cohort of critical COVID-19 patients with different systemic signatures of pyroptosis, iron dyshomeostasis, ferroptosis or pneumocyte cell death markers that have different outcomes in ICU. The distinct groups may allow 'personalized' treatment allocation in critical COVID-19 based on systemic biomarker profiles.",

Although it was previously suggested that seven RIPKs are part of the RIPK family, phylogenetic analysis indicates that there are only five genuine RIPKs. RIPK1 and RIPK3 are mainly involved in controlling and executing necroptosis in keratinocytes, while RIPK4 controls proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes and thereby can act as a tumor suppressor in skin.

            "abstract": "Objective: SpA patients often present with microscopic signs of gut inflammation, a risk factor for progressive disease. We investigated whether mucosal innate-like T-cells are involved in dysregulated interleukin (IL)-23/IL-17 responses in the gut-joint axis in SpA.\n\nMethods: Ileal and colonic intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL), and paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), were isolated from treatment-naive non-radiographic axial (nr-ax)SpA patients with (n=11) and without (n=14) microscopic gut inflammation, and healthy controls (n=15), undergoing ileocolonoscopy. Presence of gut inflammation was assessed histopathologically. Immunophenotyping of innate-like T-cells and conventional T-cells was performed using intracellular flow cytometry. Unsupervised clustering analysis was done by FlowSOM technology. Serum IL-17A levels were measured via Luminex.\n\nResults: Microscopic gut inflammation in nr-axSpA was characterized by increased ileal intraepithelial γδ-hi-T cells. γδ-hi T cells were also increased in PBMC of nr-axSpA patients versus healthy controls, and were strongly associated with ASDAS. The abundance of mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT)-cells and invariant natural killer T (iNKT)-cells was unaltered. Innate-like T-cells in the inflamed gut showed increased RORγt, IL-17A and IL-22 levels with loss of Tbet, a signature that was less pronounced in conventional T-cells. Presence of gut inflammation was associated with higher serum IL-17A levels. In patients treated with TNF blockade, the proportion of γδ-hi cells and RORγt expression in blood was completely restored.\n\nConclusion: Intestinal innate-like T-cells display marked type 17 skewing in the inflamed gut mucosa of nr-axSpA patients. γδ-hi T cells are linked to intestinal inflammation and disease activity in SpA.

Ground truth was determined by consensus among human readers. The inflammation classifier was trained using a ResNet18 backbone and 5-fold cross-validated on scans of spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients (n=279), postpartum (n=71), and healthy subjects (n=114); while independent SpA patient MRIs (n=243) served as test dataset. Patient-level predictions were derived from aggregating quadrant-level predictions, i.e. at least one positive quadrant.\n\nResults\nThe algorithm automatically detects the SI joints with a precision of 98.4% and segments ilium/sacrum with an intersection-over-union of 85.6% and 67.9%, respectively. The inflammation classifier performed well in cross-validation: area under the curve (AUC) 94.5%, balanced accuracy (B-ACC) 80.5%, and F1 score 64.1%. In the test dataset, AUC was 88.2%, B-ACC 72.1%, and F1 score 50.8%. On a patient-level, the model achieved a B-ACC of 81.6% and 81.4% in the cross-validation and test dataset, respectively.\n\nConclusion\nWe propose a fully automated ML pipeline that enables objective and standardized evaluation of BMO along the SI joints on MRI.

Benchmarking is important for all methods, but with a focus here on computational methods, benchmarking is critical to dissect important steps of analysis pipelines, formally assess performance across common situations as well as edge cases, and ultimately guide users on what tools to use. Benchmarking can also be important for community building and advancing methods in a principled way. We conducted a meta-analysis of recent single-cell benchmarks to summarize the scope, extensibility, and neutrality, as well as technical features and whether best practices in open data and reproducible research were followed. The results highlight that while benchmarks often make code available and are in principle reproducible, they remain difficult to extend, for example, as new methods and new ways to assess methods emerge. In addition, embracing containerization and workflow systems would enhance reusability of intermediate benchmarking results, thus also driving wider adoption.",

            "abstract": "Although the plant kingdom provides an enormous diversity of metabolites with potentially beneficial applications for humankind, a large fraction of these metabolites and their biosynthetic pathways remain unknown. Resolving metabolite structures and their biosynthetic pathways is key to gaining biological understanding and to allow metabolic engineering. In order to retrieve novel biosynthetic genes involved in specialized metabolism, we developed a novel untargeted method designated as qualitative trait GWAS (QT-GWAS) that subjects qualitative metabolic traits to a genome-wide association study, while the conventional metabolite GWAS (mGWAS) mainly considers the quantitative variation of metabolites. As a proof of the validity of QT-GWAS, 23 and 15 of the retrieved associations identified in Arabidopsis thaliana by QT-GWAS and mGWAS, respectively, were supported by previous research. Furthermore, seven gene-metabolite associations retrieved by QT-GWAS were confirmed in this study through reverse genetics combined with metabolomics and/or in vitro enzyme assays. As such, we established that CYTOCHROME P450 706A5 (CYP706A5) is involved in the biosynthesis of chroman derivatives, UDP-GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE 76C3 (UGT76C3) is able to hexosylate guanine in vitro and in planta, and SULFOTRANSFERASE 202B1 (SULT202B1) catalyzes the sulfation of neolignans in vitro. Collectively, our study demonstrates that the untargeted QT-GWAS method can retrieve valid gene-metabolite associations at the level of enzyme-encoding genes, even new associations that cannot be found by the conventional mGWAS, providing a new approach for dissecting qualitative metabolic traits.",

While promising, its success largely depends on the method to evaluate treatment activity which requires sufficient resolution and specificity.\n\nMethods\nHere, we describe the 'precision oncology by single-cell profiling using ex vivoreadouts of functionality' (PROSPERO) assay to evaluate the intrinsic susceptibility of high-grade brain tumor cells to respond to therapy. Different from other assays, PROSPERO extends beyond life/death screening by rapidly evaluating acute molecular drug responses at single-cell resolution.\n\nResults\nThe PROSPERO assay was developed by correlating short-term single-cell molecular signatures using mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) to long-term cytotoxicity readouts in representative patient-derived glioblastoma cell cultures (n = 14) that were exposed to radiotherapy and the small-molecule p53/MDM2 inhibitor AMG232. The predictive model was subsequently projected to evaluate drug activity in freshly resected GBM samples from patients (n = 34). Here, PROSPERO revealed an overall limited capacity of tumor cells to respond to therapy, as reflected by the inability to induce key molecular markers upon ex vivo treatment exposure, while retaining proliferative capacity, insights that were validated in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. This approach also allowed the investigation of cellular plasticity, which in PDCLs highlighted therapy-induced proneural-to-mesenchymal (PMT) transitions, while in patients' samples this was more heterogeneous.\n\nConclusion\nPROSPERO provides a precise way to evaluate therapy efficacy by measuring molecular drug responses using specific biomarker changes in freshly resected brain tumor samples, in addition to providing key functional insights in cellular behavior, which may ultimately complement standard, clinical biomarker evaluations.",

Dysfunctional autoimmune Tregs display pro-inflammatory features and altered mitochondrial metabolism, but contributing factors remain elusive. High salt (HS) has been identified to alter immune function and to promote autoimmunity. By investigating longitudinal transcriptional changes of human Tregs, we identified that HS induces metabolic reprogramming, recapitulating features of autoimmune Tregs. Mechanistically, extracellular HS raises intracellular Na+, perturbing mitochondrial respiration by interfering with the electron transport chain (ETC). Metabolic disturbance by a temporary HS encounter or complex III blockade rapidly induces a pro-inflammatory signature and FOXP3 downregulation, leading to long-term dysfunction in vitro and in vivo. The HS-induced effect could be reversed by inhibition of mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCLX). Our results indicate that salt could contribute to metabolic reprogramming and that short-term HS encounter perturb metabolic fitness and long-term function of human Tregs with important implications for autoimmunity.",

Equally, it is unclear whether growth and metastatic dissemination are supported by overlapping or distinct melanoma subpopulations. Here, by combining mouse genetics, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, lineage tracing and quantitative modelling, we provide evidence of a hierarchical model of tumour growth that mirrors the cellular and molecular logic underlying the cell-fate specification and differentiation of the embryonic neural crest. We show that tumorigenic competence is associated with a spatially localized perivascular niche, a phenotype acquired through an intercellular communication pathway established by endothelial cells. Consistent with a model in which only a fraction of cells are fated to fuel growth, temporal single-cell tracing of a population of melanoma cells with a mesenchymal-like state revealed that these cells do not contribute to primary tumour growth but, instead, constitute a pool of metastatic initiating cells that switch cell identity while disseminating to secondary organs. Our data provide a spatially and temporally resolved map of the diversity and trajectories of melanoma cell states and suggest that the ability to support growth and metastasis are limited to distinct pools of cells. The observation that these phenotypic competencies can be dynamically acquired after exposure to specific niche signals warrant the development of therapeutic strategies that interfere with the cancer cell reprogramming activity of such microenvironmental cues.",

            "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer types in men and represents an increasing global problem due to the modern Western lifestyle. The signalling adapter protein CARD14 is specifically expressed in epithelial cells, where it has been shown to mediate NF-kappa B signalling, but a role for CARD14 in carcinoma has not yet been described. By analysing existing cancer databases, we found that CARD14 overexpression strongly correlates with aggressive PCa in human patients. Moreover, we showed that CARD14 is overexpressed in the LNCaP PCa cell line and that knockdown of CARD14 severely reduces LNCaP cell survival. Similarly, knockdown of BCL10 and MALT1, which are known to form a signalling complex with CARD14, also induced LNCaP cell death. MALT1 is a paracaspase that mediates downstream signalling by acting as a scaffold, as well as a protease. Recent studies have already indicated a role for the scaffold function of MALT1 in PCa cell growth. Here, we also demonstrated constitutive MALT1 proteolytic activity in several PCa cell lines, leading to cleavage of A20 and CYLD. Inhibition of MALT1 protease activity did not affect PCa cell survival nor activation of NF-kappa B and INK signalling, but reduced expression of cancer-associated genes, including the cytokine IL-6. Taken together, our results revealed a novel role for CARD14-induced signalling in regulating PCa cell survival and gene expression. The epithelial cell type-specific expression of CARD14 may offer novel opportunities for more specific therapeutic targeting approaches in PCa.",

Recently published multiplexing techniques using oligo-conjugated antibodies or -lipids allow barcoding sample-specific cells, a process called \"hashing.\" Results Here, we compare the hashing performance of TotalSeq-A and -C antibodies, custom synthesized lipids and MULTI-seq lipid hashes in four cell lines, both for single-cell RNA-seq and single-nucleus RNA-seq. We also compare TotalSeq-B antibodies with CellPlex reagents (10x Genomics) on human PBMCs and TotalSeq-B with different lipids on primary mouse tissues. Hashing efficiency was evaluated using the intrinsic genetic variation of the cell lines and mouse strains. Antibody hashing was further evaluated on clinical samples using PBMCs from healthy and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, where we demonstrate a more affordable approach for large single-cell sequencing clinical studies, while simultaneously reducing batch effects. Conclusions Benchmarking of different hashing strategies and computational pipelines indicates that correct demultiplexing can be achieved with both lipid- and antibody-hashed human cells and nuclei, with MULTISeqDemux as the preferred demultiplexing function and antibody-based hashing as the most efficient protocol on cells. On nuclei datasets, lipid hashing delivers the best results. Lipid hashing also outperforms antibodies on cells isolated from mouse brain.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches have transformed our ability to resolve cellular properties across systems, but are currently tailored toward large cell inputs (>1,000 cells). This renders them inefficient and costly when processing small, individual tissue samples, a problem that tends to be resolved by loading bulk samples, yielding confounded mosaic cell population read-outs. Here, we developed a deterministic, mRNA-capture bead and cell co-encapsulation dropleting system, DisCo, aimed at processing low-input samples (<500 cells). We demonstrate that DisCo enables precise particle and cell positioning and droplet sorting control through combined machine-vision and multilayer microfluidics, enabling continuous processing of low-input single-cell suspensions at high capture efficiency (>70%) and at speeds up to 350 cells per hour. To underscore DisCo's unique capabilities, we analyzed 31 individual intestinal organoids at varying developmental stages. This revealed extensive organoid heterogeneity, identifying distinct subtypes including a regenerative fetal-like Ly6a(+) stem cell population that persists as symmetrical cysts, or spheroids, even under differentiation conditions, and an uncharacterized 'gobloid' subtype consisting predominantly of precursor and mature (Muc2(+)) goblet cells. To complement this dataset and to demonstrate DisCo's capacity to process low-input, in vivo-derived tissues, we also analyzed individual mouse intestinal crypts. This revealed the existence of crypts with a compositional similarity to spheroids, which consisted predominantly of regenerative stem cells, suggesting the existence of regenerating crypts in the homeostatic intestine. These findings demonstrate the unique power of DisCo in providing high-resolution snapshots of cellular heterogeneity in small, individual tissues.",

Within patients, we compared chemonaive with chemotreated samples. As such, we were able to create a single-cell atlas of different HGSOC lesions and their treatment. This revealed a high intrapatient concordance between spatially distinct metastases. In addition, we found remarkable baseline differences in transcriptomics of ascitic and solid cancer cells, resulting in a different response to chemotherapy. Moreover, we discovered different robust subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) in all patients. Besides inflammatory CAFs, vascular CAFs, and matrix CAFs, we identified a new CAF subtype that was characterized by high expression of STAR, TSPAN8, and ALDH1A1 and clearly enriched after chemotherapy.

We studied two independent cohorts of patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings. Primary tolerance was associated with long-lasting reshaping of the recipients' immune system compared to their healthy donors with an increased proportion of regulatory T cell subsets and decreased T cell activation, proliferation, and migration. Transcriptomics profiles also identified a role for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide biosynthesis in the regulation of immune cell functions. We then compared individuals with operational tolerance and nontolerant recipients at the phenotypic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic level. We observed alterations centered on CD38(+)-activated T and B cells in nontolerant patients. In tolerant patients, cell subsets with regulatory functions were prominent. RNA sequencing analyses highlighted modifications in the tolerant patients' transcriptomic profiles, particularly with overexpression of the ectoenzyme NT5E (encoding CD73), which could counterbalance CD38 enzymatic functions by producing adenosine. Further, metabolomic analyses suggested a central role of androgens in establishing operational tolerance. These data were confirmed using an integrative approach to evaluating the immune landscape associated with operational tolerance. Thus, balance between a CD38-activated immune state and CD73-related production of adenosine may be a key regulator of operational tolerance.",

            "abstract": "In cytometry analysis, a large number of markers is measured for thousands or millions of cells, resulting in high-dimensional datasets. During the measurement of these samples, erroneous events can occur such as clogs, speed changes, slow uptake of the sample etc., which can influence the downstream analysis and can even lead to false discoveries. As these issues can be difficult to detect manually, an automated approach is recommended. In order to filter these erroneous events out, we created a novel quality control algorithm, Peak Extraction And Cleaning Oriented Quality Control (PeacoQC), that allows for automated cleaning of cytometry data. The algorithm will determine density peaks per channel on which it will remove low quality events based on their position in the isolation tree and on their mean absolute deviation distance to these density peaks. To evaluate PeacoQC's cleaning capability, it was compared to three other existing quality control algorithms (flowAI, flowClean and flowCut) on a wide variety of datasets. In comparison to the other algorithms, PeacoQC was able to filter out all different types of anomalies in flow, mass and spectral cytometry data, while the other methods struggled with at least one type. In the quantitative comparison, PeacoQC obtained the highest median balanced accuracy and a similar running time compared to the other algorithms while having a better scalability for large files. To ensure that the parameters chosen in the PeacoQC algorithm are robust, the cleaning tool was run on 16 public datasets. After inspection, only one sample was found where the parameters should be further optimized. The other 15 datasets were analyzed correctly indicating a robust parameter choice. Overall, we present a fast and accurate quality control algorithm that outperforms existing tools and ensures high-quality data that can be used for further downstream analysis. An R implementation is available.",

A detailed understanding of the brain immune landscape is essential for developing new treatments for neurological disorders. Single-cell technologies offer an unbiased assessment of the heterogeneity, dynamics and functions of immune cells. Here we provide a protocol that outlines all the steps involved in performing single-cell multi-omic analysis of the brain immune compartment. This includes a step-by-step description on how to microdissect the border regions of the mouse brain, together with dissociation protocols tailored to each of these tissues. These combine a high yield with minimal dissociation-induced gene expression changes. Next, we outline the steps involved for high-dimensional flow cytometry and droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing via the 10x Genomics platform, which can be combined with cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) and offers a higher throughput than plate-based methods. Importantly, we detail how to implement CITE-seq with large antibody panels to obtain unbiased protein-expression screening coupled to transcriptome analysis. Finally, we describe the main steps involved in the analysis and interpretation of the data. This optimized workflow allows for a detailed assessment of immune cell heterogeneity and activation in the whole brain or specific border regions, at RNA and protein level. The wet lab workflow can be completed by properly trained researchers (with basic proficiency in cell and molecular biology) and takes between 6 and 11 h, depending on the chosen procedures. The computational analysis requires a background in bioinformatics and programming in R.",

In addition, water and nutrients for leaf growth are transported through the vascular tissue.

The detection of approximately 19,000 different transcripts in over 1,800 high-quality leaf cells revealed 14 cell populations composing the young, differentiating leaf. Besides the cell populations comprising the core leaf tissues, we identified subpopulations with a distinct identity or metabolic activity.

We compared MIS-C immunopathology with severe COVID-19 in adults. MIS-C does not result in pneumocyte damage but is associated with vascular endotheliitis and gastrointestinal epithelial injury. In MIS-C, the cytokine release syndrome is characterized by IFN gamma and not type I interferon. Persistence of patrolling monocytes differentiates MIS-C from severe COVID-19, which is dominated by HLA-DRlo classical monocytes. IFN gamma levels correlate with granzyme B production in CD16(+) NK cells and TIM3 expression on CD38(+)/HLA-DR+ T cells. Single-cell TCR profiling reveals a skewed TCR beta repertoire enriched for TRBV11-2 and a superantigenic signature in TIM3(+)/CD38(+)/HLA-DR+ T cells. Using NicheNet, we confirm IFN gamma as a central cytokine in the communication between TIM3(+)/CD38(+)/HLA-DR+ T cells, CD16(+) NK cells, and patrolling monocytes. Normalization of IFN gamma, loss of TIM3, quiescence of CD16(+) NK cells, and contraction of patrolling monocytes upon clinical resolution highlight their potential role in MIS-C immunopathogenesis.\r\n\r\nMIS-C is a novel immunodysregulation syndrome in children with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Besides life-supporting treatments, no cure exists, and its mechanisms are still poorly understood. Catalytic iron is associated with ICU mortality and is known to cause free radical-mediated cellular toxicity. It is thought to induce excessive lipid peroxidation, the main characteristic of an iron-dependent type of cell death conceptualized as ferroptosis. Here we show that the severity of multiorgan dysfunction and the probability of death are indeed associated with plasma catalytic iron and lipid peroxidation. Transgenic approaches underscore the role of ferroptosis in iron-induced multiorgan dysfunction. Blocking lipid peroxidation with our highly soluble ferrostatin-analogue protects mice from injury and death in experimental non-septic multiorgan dysfunction, but not in sepsis-induced multiorgan dysfunction. The limitations of the experimental mice models to mimic the complexity of clinical MODS warrant further preclinical testing. In conclusion, our data suggest ferroptosis targeting as possible treatment option for a stratifiable subset of MODS patients.",

            "abstract": "IntroductionMultiparameter flow cytometry (FCM) immunophenotyping is an important tool in the diagnostic screening and classification of primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs). The EuroFlow Consortium recently developed the PID Orientation Tube (PIDOT) as a universal screening tool to identify lymphoid-PID in suspicious patients. Although PIDOT can identify different lymphoid-PIDs with high sensitivity, clinical validation in a broad spectrum of patients with suspicion of PID is missing. In this study, we investigated the diagnostic performance of PIDOT, as part of the EuroFlow diagnostic screening algorithm for lymphoid-PID, in a daily practice at a tertiary reference center for PID. MethodsPIDOT was tested in 887 consecutive patients suspicious of PID at the Ghent University Hospital, Belgium. Patients were classified into distinct subgroups of lymphoid-PID vs. non-PID disease controls (non-PID DCs), according to the IUIS and ESID criteria. For the clinical validation of PIDOT, comprehensive characterization of the lymphoid defects was performed, together with the identification of the most discriminative cell subsets to distinguish lymphoid-PID from non-PID DCs. Next, a decision-tree algorithm was designed to guide subsequent FCM analyses. ResultsThe mean number of lymphoid defects detected by PIDOT in blood was 2.87 times higher in lymphoid-PID patients vs. non-PID DCs (p < 0.001), resulting in an overall sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 62% to detect severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), combined immunodeficiency with associated or syndromic features (CID), immune dysregulation disorder (ID), and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). The most discriminative populations were total memory and switched memory B cells, total T cells, TCD4+cells, and naive TCD4+cells, together with serum immunoglobulin levels. Based on these findings, a decision-tree algorithm was designed to guide further FCM analyses, which resulted in an overall sensitivity and specificity for all lymphoid-PIDs of 86% and 82%, respectively. ConclusionAltogether, our findings confirm that PIDOT is a powerful tool for the diagnostic screening of lymphoid-PID, particularly to discriminate (S)CID, ID, and CVID patients from other patients suspicious of PID. The combination of PIDOT and serum immunoglobulin levels provides an efficient guide for further immunophenotypic FCM analyses, complementary to functional and genetic assays, for accurate PID diagnostics.",

During obesity, macrophages accumulate in the visceral adipose tissue, creating a low-grade inflammatory environment. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling is a central coordinator of inflammatory responses and is tightly regulated by the anti-inflammatory protein A20. Here, we find that myeloid-specific A20-deficient mice are protected from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance despite an inflammatory environment in their metabolic tissues. Macrophages lacking A20 show impaired mitochondrial respiratory function and metabolize more palmitate both in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesize that A20-deficient macrophages rely more on palmitate oxidation and metabolize the fat present in the diet, resulting in a lean phenotype and protection from metabolic disease.

The field is therefore slowly moving toward more automated approaches, and in this paper we describe the protocol for analyzing high-dimensional cytometry data using FlowSOM, a clustering and visualization algorithm based on a self-organizing map. FlowSOM is used to distinguish cell populations from cytometry data in an unsupervised way and can help to gain deeper insights in fields such as immunology and oncology. Since the original FlowSOM publication (2015), we have validated the tool on a wide variety of datasets, and to write this protocol, we made use of this experience to improve the user-friendliness of the package (e.g., comprehensive functions replacing commonly required scripts). Where the original paper focused mainly on the algorithm description, this protocol offers user guidelines on how to implement the procedure, detailed parameter descriptions and troubleshooting recommendations. The protocol provides clearly annotated R code, and is therefore relevant for all scientists interested in computational high-dimensional analyses without requiring a strong bioinformatics background. We demonstrate the complete workflow, starting from data preparation (such as compensation, transformation and quality control), including detailed discussion of the different FlowSOM parameters and visualization options, and concluding with how the results can be further used to answer biological questions, such as statistical comparison between groups of interest. An average FlowSOM analysis takes 1-3 h to complete, though quality issues can increase this time considerably. This protocol describes FlowSOM, a clustering and visualization algorithm for unsupervised analysis of high-dimensional cytometry data. The protocol provides clearly annotated R code and an example dataset for inexperienced users.",

While insights into the early stages of the disease are rapidly expanding, the dynamic immunological processes occurring in critically ill patients throughout their recovery at ICU are far less understood. Here, we have analysed whole blood samples serially collected from 40 surviving COVID-19 patients throughout their recovery in ICU using high-dimensional cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) and cytokine multiplexing. Based on the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), we defined four sequential immunotypes during recovery that correlated to various clinical parameters, including the level of respiratory support at concomitant sampling times. We identified classical monocytes as the first immune cell type to recover by restoration of HLA-DR-positivity and the reduction of immunosuppressive CD163 + monocytes, followed by the recovery of CD8 + and CD4 + T cell and non-classical monocyte populations. The identified immunotypes also correlated to aberrant cytokine and acute-phase reactant levels. Finally, integrative analysis of cytokines and immune cell profiles showed a shift from an initially dysregulated immune response to a more coordinated immunogenic interplay, highlighting the importance of longitudinal sampling to understand the pathophysiology underlying recovery from severe COVID-19.",

However, the proportion of patients experiencing a durable response is still limited. In the current study, we performed an extensive immune monitoring in patients with stage III/IV melanoma and stage IV UC who received anti-PD-1 immunotherapy with SBRT. (2) Methods: In total 145 blood samples from 38 patients, collected at fixed time points before and during treatment, were phenotyped via high-parameter flow cytometry, luminex assay and UPLC-MS/MS. (3) Results: Baseline systemic immunity in melanoma and UC patients was different with a more prominent myeloid compartment and a higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in UC. Proliferation (Ki67+) of CD8+ T-cells and of the PD-1+/PD-L1+ CD8+ subset at baseline correlated with progression free survival in melanoma. In contrast a higher frequency of PD-1/PD-L1 expressing non-proliferating (Ki67−) CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells before treatment was associated with worse outcome in melanoma. In UC, the expansion of Ki67+ CD8+ T-cells and of the PD-L1+ subset relative to tumor burden correlated with clinical outcome. (4) Conclusion: This study reveals a clearly different immune landscape in melanoma and UC at baseline, which may impact immunotherapy response. Signatures of proliferation in the CD8+ T-cell compartment prior to and early after anti-PD-1 initiation were positively correlated with clinical outcome in both cohorts.

Using transcriptomic and metabolic analyses, we now reveal that pro-inflammatory major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-IIhi TAMs display a hampered tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, while reparative MHC-IIlo TAMs show higher oxidative and glycolytic metabolism. Although both TAM subsets rapidly exchange lactate in high-lactate conditions, only MHC-IIlo TAMs use lactate as an additional carbon source. Accordingly, lactate supports the oxidative metabolism in MHC-IIlo TAMs, while it decreases the metabolic activity of MHC-IIhi TAMs. Lactate subtly affects the transcriptome of MHC-IIlo TAMs, increases L-arginine metabolism, and enhances the T cell suppressive capacity of these TAMs. Overall, our data uncover the metabolic intricacies of distinct TAM subsets and identify lactate as a carbon source and metabolic and functional regulator of TAMs.",

            "abstract": "Despite the scientific and economic importance of maize, little is known about its specialized metabolism. Here, five maize organs were profiled using different reversed-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. The resulting spectral metadata, combined with candidate substrate-product pair (CSPP) networks, allowed the structural characterization of 427 of the 5,420 profiled compounds, including phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, benzoxazinoids, and auxin-related compounds, among others. Only 75 of the 427 compounds were already described in maize. Analysis of the CSPP networks showed that phenylpropanoids are present in all organs, whereas other metabolic classes are rather organ-enriched. Frequently occurring CSPP mass differences often corresponded with glycosyl- and acyltransferase reactions. The interplay of glycosylations and acylations yields a wide variety of mixed glycosides, bearing substructures corresponding to the different biochemical classes. For example, in the tassel, many phenylpropanoid and flavonoid-bearing glycosides also contain auxin-derived moieties. The characterized compounds and mass differences are an important step forward in metabolic pathway discovery and systems biology research. The spectral metadata of the 5,420 compounds is publicly available (DynLib spectral database, https://bioit3.irc.ugent.be/dynlib/).",

To elucidate the immunopathology underlying COVID-19 severity, we perform cytokine and multiplex immune profiling in COVID-19 patients. We show that hypercytokinemia in COVID-19 differs from the interferon-gamma-driven cytokine storm in macrophage activation syndrome, and is more pronounced in critical versus mild-moderate COVID-19. Systems modelling of cytokine levels paired with deep-immune profiling shows that classical monocytes drive this hyper-inflammatory phenotype and that a reduction in T-lymphocytes correlates with disease severity, with CD8+ cells being disproportionately affected. Antigen presenting machinery expression is also reduced in critical disease. Furthermore, we report that neutrophils contribute to disease severity and local tissue damage by amplification of hypercytokinemia and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Together our findings suggest a myeloid-driven immunopathology, in which hyperactivated neutrophils and an ineffective adaptive immune system act as mediators of COVID-19 disease severity. The host immune response plays a critical role in the immunopathology of SARS-CoV2. Here the authors combine a systems biology approach to implicate monocytes as key drivers of cytokine storm and disturbed neutrophil activation in COVID-19 disease severity.",

Here the authors show, using genetic mouse models and single-cell RNA-sequencing, that deficiency of OTULIN in keratinocytes causes skin inflammation and verrucous carcinoma via the induction of keratinocyte death, thereby implicating a function of OTULIN in keratinocyte homeostasis. OTULIN is a deubiquitinase that specifically cleaves linear ubiquitin chains. Here we demonstrate that the ablation of Otulin selectively in keratinocytes causes inflammatory skin lesions that develop into verrucous carcinomas. Genetic deletion of Tnfr1, knockin expression of kinase-inactive Ripk1 or keratinocyte-specific deletion of Fadd and Mlkl completely rescues mice with OTULIN deficiency from dermatitis and tumorigenesis, thereby identifying keratinocyte cell death as the driving force for inflammation. Single-cell RNA-sequencing comparing non-lesional and lesional skin reveals changes in epidermal stem cell identity in OTULIN-deficient keratinocytes prior to substantial immune cell infiltration. Keratinocytes lacking OTULIN display a type-1 interferon and IL-1 beta response signature, and genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of these cytokines partially inhibits skin inflammation. Finally, expression of a hypomorphic mutant Otulin allele, previously shown to cause OTULIN-related autoinflammatory syndrome in humans, induces a similar inflammatory phenotype, thus supporting the importance of OTULIN for restraining skin inflammation and maintaining immune homeostasis.",

Classical problems, which are getting bigger and bigger, require more and more resources for their processing, and Big Data technologies offer many solutions. Although the principal algorithms for traditional vector-based problems are available in Big Data environments, the lack of tools for time series processing in these environments needs to be addressed. In this work, we propose a scalable and distributed time series transformation for Big Data environments based on well-known time series features (SCMFTS), which allows practitioners to apply traditional vector-based algorithms to time series problems. The proposed transformation, along with the algorithms available in Spark, improved the best results in the state-of-the-art on the Wearable Stress and Affect Detection dataset, which is the biggest publicly available multivariate time series dataset in the University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. In addition, SCMFTS showed a linear relationship between its runtime and the number of processed time series, demonstrating a linear scalable behavior, which is mandatory in Big Data environments. SCMFTS has been implemented in the Scala programming language for the Apache Spark framework, and the code is publicly available.(1)",

This revealed a large and diverse myeloid compartment, with dendritic cell and macrophage populations that were conserved across species and dynamic across disease stages. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) consisted of microglia- or monocyte-derived populations, with both exhibiting additional heterogeneity, including subsets with conserved lipid and hypoxic signatures. Microglia- and monocyte-derived TAMs were self-renewing populations that competed for space and could be depleted via CSF1R blockade. Microglia-derived TAMs were predominant in newly diagnosed tumors, but were outnumbered by monocyte-derived TAMs following recurrence, especially in hypoxic tumor environments.

In order to preserve sample composition and phenotype, blood samples should be analyzed within 24 h after bleeding, restricting the recruitment, analysis protocols, as well as biobanking. Herein, we have evaluated two whole blood preservation protocols that allow rapid sample processing and long-term stability. Two fixation buffers were used, Phosphoflow Fix and Lyse (BD) and Proteomic Stabilizer (PROT) to fix and freeze whole blood samples for up to 6 months. After analysis by an 8-plex panel by FC and a 26-plex panel by MC, manual gating of circulating leukocyte populations and cytokines was performed. Additionally, we tested the stability of a single sample over a 13-months period using 45 consecutive aliquots and a 34-plex panel by MC. We observed high correlation and low bias toward any cell population when comparing fresh and 6 months frozen blood with FC and MC. This correlation was confirmed by hierarchical clustering. Low coefficients of variation (CV) across studied time points indicate good sample preservation for up to 6 months. Cytokine detection stability was confirmed by low CVs, with some differences between fresh and fixed conditions. Thirteen months regular follow-up of PROT samples showed remarkable sample stability. Whole blood can be preserved for phenotyping and cytokine-response studies provided the careful selection of a compatible antibody panel. However, possible changes in cell morphology, differences in antibody affinity, and changes in cytokine-positive cell frequencies when compared to fresh blood should be considered. Our setting constitutes a valuable tool for multicentric and retrospective studies. (c) 2020 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry",

For point clouds, these diagrams are often derived from the Vietoris-Rips filtration—based on the metric equipped on the data—which allows one to deduce topological patterns such as components and cycles of the underlying space. In metric trees these diagrams often fail to capture other crucial topological properties, such as the present leaves and multifurcations. Prior methods and results for persistent homology attempting to overcome this issue mainly target Rips graphs, which are often unfavorable in case of non-uniform density across our point cloud. We therefore introduce a new theoretical foundation for learning a wider variety of topological patterns through any given graph. Given particular powerful functions defining persistence diagrams to summarize topological patterns, including the normalized centrality or eccentricity, we prove a new stability result, explicitly bounding the bottleneck distance between the true and empirical diagrams for metric trees. This bound is tight if the metric distortion obtained through the graph and its maximal edge-weight are small. Through a case study of gene expression data, we demonstrate that our newly introduced diagrams provide novel quality measures and insights into cell trajectory inference.",

Here the authors describe a detailed protocol for pySCENIC: a faster, container-based implementation in Python. This protocol explains how to perform a fast SCENIC analysis alongside standard best practices steps on single-cell RNA-sequencing data using software containers and Nextflow pipelines. SCENIC reconstructs regulons (i.e., transcription factors and their target genes) assesses the activity of these discovered regulons in individual cells and uses these cellular activity patterns to find meaningful clusters of cells. Here we present an improved version of SCENIC with several advances. SCENIC has been refactored and reimplemented in Python (pySCENIC), resulting in a tenfold increase in speed, and has been packaged into containers for ease of use. It is now also possible to use epigenomic track databases, as well as motifs, to refine regulons. In this protocol, we explain the different steps of SCENIC: the workflow starts from the count matrix depicting the gene abundances for all cells and consists of three stages. First, coexpression modules are inferred using a regression per-target approach (GRNBoost2). Next, the indirect targets are pruned from these modules using cis-regulatory motif discovery (cisTarget). Lastly, the activity of these regulons is quantified via an enrichment score for the regulon's target genes (AUCell). Nonlinear projection methods can be used to display visual groupings of cells based on the cellular activity patterns of these regulons. The results can be exported as a loom file and visualized in the SCope web application. This protocol is illustrated on two use cases: a peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set and a panel of single-cell RNA-sequencing cancer experiments.

Addressing this task is challenging as (i) it requires analyzing massive databases in reasonable periods and (ii) it is commonly solved by combining different methods with very complex data-dependencies, which make fully exploiting heterogeneous CPU-GPU systems very complex. Most efforts in this context focus on improving the accuracy of the approaches and neglect reducing the processing time. Indeed, the most accurate approach was designed for one single thread. This work introduces the fastest methodology for latent fingerprint identification maintaining high accuracy called Asynchronous processing for Latent Fingerprint Identification (ALFI). ALFI fully exploits all the resources of CPU-GPU systems using asynchronous processing and fine-coarse parallelism for analyzing massive databases. Our approach reduces idle times in processing and exploits the inherent parallelism of comparing latent fingerprints to fingerprint impressions. We analyzed the performance of ALFI on Linux and Windows operating systems using the well-known NIST/FVC databases. Experimental results reveal that ALFI is in average 22x faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm, reaching a value of 44.7x for the best-studied case.",

The resulting high-content data sets allow characterizing the human immune system at unprecedented single cell resolution. However, the results are highly dependent on sample preparation and measurements might drift over time. While various controls exist for assessment and improvement of data quality in a single sample, the challenges of cross-sample normalization attempts have been limited to aligning marker distributions across subjects. These approaches, inspired by bulk genomics and proteomics assays, ignore the single-cell nature of the data and risk the removal of biologically relevant signals. This work proposes CytoNorm, a normalization algorithm to ensure internal consistency between clinical samples based on shared controls across various study batches. Data from the shared controls is used to learn the appropriate transformations for each batch (e.g., each analysis day). Importantly, some sources of technical variation are strongly influenced by the amount of protein expressed on specific cell types, requiring several population-specific transformations to normalize cells from a heterogeneous sample. To address this, our approach first identifies the overall cellular distribution using a clustering step, and calculates subset-specific transformations on the control samples by computing their quantile distributions and aligning them with splines. These transformations are then applied to all other clinical samples in the batch to remove the batch-specific variations. We evaluated the algorithm on a customized data set with two shared controls across batches. One control sample was used for calculation of the normalization transformations and the second control was used as a blinded test set and evaluated with Earth Mover's distance. Additional results are provided using two real-world clinical data sets. Overall, our method compared favorably to standard normalization procedures.",

Using single-cell technologies in models of respiratory viral infection, we found that lung cDC2s acquired expression of the Fc receptor CD64 shared with MCs and of IRF8 shared with cDC1s. These inflammatory cDC2s (inf-cDC2s) were superior in inducing CD4+ T helper (Th) cell polarization while simultaneously presenting antigen to CD8+ T cells. When carefully separated from inf-cDC2s, MCs lacked APC function. Inf-cDC2s matured in response to cell-intrinsic Toll-like receptor and type 1 interferon receptor signaling, upregulated an IRF8-dependent maturation module, and acquired antigens via convalescent serum and Fc receptors.

Trajectory inference delineated the transcriptional dynamics underlying early human T lineage development, enabling prediction of transcription factor (TF) modules that drive stage-specific steps of human T cell development. This comprehensive dataset defines the expression signature of immature human thymocytes and provides a resource for the further study of human thymopoiesis.",

            "abstract": "We consider the problem of inferring simplified topological substructures—which we term backbones—in metric and non-metric graphs. Intuitively, these are subgraphs with ‘few’ nodes, multifurcations, and cycles, that model the topology of the original graph well. We present a multistep procedure for inferring these backbones. First, we encode local (geometric) information of each vertex in the original graph by means of the boundary coefficient (BC) to identify ‘core’ nodes in the graph. Next, we construct a forest representation of the graph, termed an f-pine, that connects every node of the graph to a local ‘core’ node. The final backbone is then inferred from the f-pine through CLOF (Constrained Leaves Optimal subForest), a novel graph optimization problem we introduce in this paper. On a theoretical level, we show that CLOF is NP-hard for general graphs. However, we prove that CLOF can be efficiently solved for forest graphs, a surprising fact given that CLOF induces a nontrivial monotone submodular set function maximization problem on tree graphs. This result is the basis of our method for mining backbones in graphs through forest representation. We qualitatively and quantitatively confirm the applicability, effectiveness, and scalability of our method for discovering backbones in a variety of graph-structured data, such as social networks, earthquake locations scattered across the Earth, and high-dimensional cell trajectory data",

Genetic ablation of Fas-associated death domain (FADD) completely rescues and knockin expression of kinase inactive receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) significantly protects mice from developing liver disease, demonstrating that apoptosis of OTULIN-deficient hepatocytes triggers disease pathogenesis in this model.

Here, we demonstrated that KCs were reduced in MAFLD being replaced by macrophages originating from the bone marrow. Recruited macrophages existed in two subsets with distinct activation states, either closely resembling homeostatic KCs or lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) from obese adipose tissue. Hepatic LAMs expressed Osteopontin, a biomarker for patients with NASH, linked with the development of fibrosis. Fitting with this, LAMs were found in regions of the liver with reduced numbers of KCs, characterized by increased Desmin expression.

These cells lack the main microglia identity and have a distinct origin. While CNS microglia have been extensively studied, relatively little is known about macrophages populating the peripheral nervous system. Here we performed ontogenic, transcriptomic and spatial characterization of sciatic nerve macrophages (snMacs). Using multiple fate-mapping systems, we show that snMacs do not derive from the early embryonic precursors colonizing the CNS, but originate primarily from late embryonic precursors and become replaced by bone-marrow-derived macrophages over time. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we identified a tissue-specific core signature of snMacs and two spatially separated snMacs: Relm alpha(+)Mgl1(+) snMacs in the epineurium and Relm alpha(-)Mgl1(-) snMacs in the endoneurium. Globally, snMacs lack most of the core signature genes of microglia, with only the endoneurial subset expressing a restricted number of these genes. In response to nerve injury, the two resident snMac populations respond differently. Moreover, and unlike in the CNS, monocyte-derived macrophages that develop during injury can engraft efficiently in the pool of resident peripheral nervous system macrophages.",

Unsupervised problems are of particular relevance, as the generation of labels for the data is often labor-intensive, expensive or simply not possible. However, interpretability of the data and the results is key to extract new valuable knowledge from the large-scale datasets that are studied. This highlights the necessity of adequate unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques that can lower the computational workload necessary to process the dataset, while at the same time providing information on its structure. This paper describes a framework that brings together previous proposals on unsupervised feature clustering, with the goal of providing a scalable, interpretable and robust dimensionality reduction on single-cell imaging data. The framework integrates several inter-feature dissimilarity measures, clustering algorithms, quality criteria to select the best feature clustering, and dimensionality reduction methods that are built on the clustering. For each of these components, several approaches proposed in previous works have been tested and evaluated on three use cases coming from two different imaging datasets, highlighting the best-performing components. Affinity clustering is applied for feature clustering for the first time. The results were validated using statistical tests, showing that many of the combinations tested lowered the complexity of the datasets while maintaining or improving the accuracy yielded by classifiers applied on them. The analysis highlighted affinity clustering as the best algorithm for feature clustering, with median differences of up to 8.9% and 0.9% in accuracy with respect to FSFS and hierarchical clustering. Representation entropy obtained a median difference of 13.0% and 0.8% with respect to class separability and silhouette index, respectively, as a robust unsupervised criterion to select the cluster set. Dissimilarities based on Pearson’s correlation performed slightly better than the alternatives, with a median improvement of 2.8% with respect to the cosine distance.",

Results: In this work, we present TinGa, a new TI model that is fast and flexible, and that is based on Growing Neural Graphs. We performed an extensive comparison of TinGa to five state-of-the-art methods for TI on a set of 250 datasets, including both synthetic as well as real datasets. Overall, TinGa improves the state-of-the-art by producing accurate models (comparable to or an improvement on the state-of-the-art) on the whole spectrum of data complexity, from the simplest linear datasets to the most complex disconnected graphs. In addition, TinGa obtained the fastest execution times, showing that our method is thus one of the most versatile methods up to date.",

Downstream of trajectory inference, it is vital to discover genes that are (i) associated with the lineages in the trajectory, or (ii) differentially expressed between lineages, to illuminate the underlying biological processes. Current data analysis procedures, however, either fail to exploit the continuous resolution provided by trajectory inference, or fail to pinpoint the exact types of differential expression. We introduce tradeSeq, a powerful generalized additive model framework based on the negative binomial distribution that allows flexible inference of both within-lineage and between-lineage differential expression. By incorporating observation-level weights, the model additionally allows to account for zero inflation. We evaluate the method on simulated datasets and on real datasets from droplet-based and full-length protocols, and show that it yields biological insights through a clear interpretation of the data. Downstream of trajectory inference for cell lineages based on scRNA-seq data, differential expression analysis yields insight into biological processes.

CVID patients suffer from recurrent infections and disease-related, non-infectious, complications such as autoimmune manifestations, lymphoproliferation, and malignancies. A timely diagnosis is essential for optimal follow-up and treatment. However, CVID is by definition a diagnosis of exclusion, thereby covering a heterogeneous patient population and making it difficult to establish a definite diagnosis. To aid the diagnosis of CVID patients, and distinguish them from other PADs, we developed an automated machine learning pipeline which performs automated diagnosis based on flow cytometric immunophenotyping. Using this pipeline, we analyzed the immunophenotypic profile in a pediatric and adult cohort of 28 patients with CVID, 23 patients with idiopathic primary hypogammaglobulinemia, 21 patients with IgG subclass deficiency, six patients with isolated IgA deficiency, one patient with isolated IgM deficiency, and 100 unrelated healthy controls. Flow cytometry analysis is traditionally done by manual identification of the cell populations of interest. Yet, this approach has severe limitations including subjectivity of the manual gating and bias toward known populations. To overcome these limitations, we here propose an automated computational flow cytometry pipeline that successfully distinguishes CVID phenotypes from other PADs and healthy controls. Compared to the traditional, manual analysis, our pipeline is fully automated, performing automated quality control and data pre-processing, automated population identification (gating) and deriving features from these populations to build a machine learning classifier to distinguish CVID from other PADs and healthy controls. This results in a more reproducible flow cytometry analysis, and improves the diagnosis compared to manual analysis: our pipelines achieve on average a balanced accuracy score of 0.93 (+/- 0.07), whereas using the manually extracted populations, an averaged balanced accuracy score of 0.72 (+/- 0.23) is achieved.",

In the quintessential hyperinflammatory syndrome familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), inborn errors of cytotoxicity result in effector cell accumulation, immune dysregulation and, if untreated, tissue damage and death. Here, we describe a human case with a homozygous nonsense R688* RC3H1 mutation suffering from hyperinflammation, presenting as relapsing HLH. RC3H1 encodes Roquin-1, a posttranscriptional repressor of immuneregulatory proteins such as ICOS, OX40 and TNF. Comparing the R688* variant with the murine M199R variant reveals a phenotypic resemblance, both in immune cell activation, hypercytokinemia and disease development. Mechanistically, R688* Roquin-1 fails to localize to P-bodies and interact with the CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex, impeding mRNA decay and dysregulating cytokine production. The results from this unique case suggest that impaired Roquin-1 function provokes hyperinflammation by a failure to quench immune activation.",

In wounds of mice lacking HMGB1 selectively in keratinocytes, a marked reduction in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation is observed. Pharmacological targeting of HMGB1 or NETs prevents skin tumorigenesis and accelerates wound regeneration. HMGB1-dependent NET formation and skin tumorigenesis is orchestrated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and requires RIPK1 kinase activity. NETs are present in the microenvironment of keratinocyte-derived tumors in mice and lesional and tumor skin of patients suffering from recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, a disease in which skin blistering predisposes to tumorigenesis.

Studies with murine norovirus (MNV) showed that protective STAT1 signaling controls viral replication and pathogenesis, but the immune mechanisms that noroviruses exploit to induce pathology are elusive. Here, we show that gastrointestinal MNV infection leads to widespread IL-1 maturation in MNV-susceptible STAT1-deficient mice. MNV activates the canonical Nlrp3 inflammasome in macrophages, leading to maturation of IL-1 and to Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-dependent pyroptosis. STAT1-deficient macrophages displayed increased MAVS-mediated expression of pro-IL-1, facilitating elevated Nlrp3-dependent release of mature IL-1 upon MNV infection. Accordingly, MNV-infected Stat1(-/-) mice showed Nlrp3-dependent maturation of IL-1 as well as Nlrp3-dependent pyroptosis as assessed by in vivo cleavage of GSDMD to its active N-terminal fragment. While MNV-induced diarrheic responses were not affected, Stat1(-/-) mice additionally lacking either Nlrp3 or GSDMD displayed lower levels of the fecal inflammatory marker Lipocalin-2 as well as delayed lethality after gastrointestinal MNV infection. Together, these results uncover new insights into the mechanisms of norovirus-induced inflammation and cell death, thereby revealing Nlrp3 inflammasome activation and ensuing GSDMD-driven pyroptosis as contributors to MNV-induced immunopathology in susceptible STAT1-deficient mice. \r\nAuthor summary: Gastrointestinal norovirus infections form a serious socio-economic worldwide problem, with about 684 million cases annually worldwide and mortality occurring both in underdeveloped countries and in immunocompromised patients. Despite the urgent global need, no specific treatments are available for norovirus induced gastroenteritis, partly because innate immune responses upon gastrointestinal norovirus infection are largely unresolved. Using the murine norovirus (MNV) model we showed that MNV infection in macrophages leads to a lytic form of cell death termed pyroptosis as well as to the maturation and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1. Maturation of IL-1 was observed also in vivo, after gastrointestinal infection of MNV-susceptible Stat1 knockout mice. We found that these innate immune responses upon MNV infection crucially depended on activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome leading to Gasdermin D-driven pyroptosis, and inactivating this signaling pathway delayed lethality of MNV-susceptible STAT1 knockout mice after gastrointestinal MNV infection. We thus identified Nlrp3 inflammasome activation and ensuing pyroptosis as a signaling pathway contributing to norovirus-induced immunopathology. Taken together, this study resulted in a more detailed understanding of MNV-induced inflammatory and cell death pathways and provided insights into how gastrointestinal viruses induce immunopathology.",

ROR gamma t, the key Thelperl7 (Th17) cell transcriptional regulator, is also expressed by subsets of innate-like T cells, including invariant natural killer T (iNKT) and gamma delta-T cells, but their contribution to SpA is still unclear. Here we describe the presence of particular ROR gamma t(+)T-be(lo)PLZF(-) iNKT and gamma delta-hi T cell subsets in healthy peripheral blood. ROR gamma t(+) iNKT and gamma delta-hi T cells show IL-23 mediated Th17-like immune responses and were clearly enriched within inflamed joints of SpA patients where they act as major IL-17 secretors. SpA derived iNKT and gamma delta-T cells showed unique and Th17-skewed phenotype and gene expression profiles. Strikingly, ROR gamma t inhibition blocked gamma delta 17 and iNKT17 cell function while selectively sparing IL-22(+) subsets. Overall, our findings highlight a unique diversity of human ROR gamma t(+) T cells and underscore the potential of ROR gamma t antagonism to modulate aberrant type 17 responses.",

Coordinated interactions with hepatocytes induced ID3 expression, whereas endothelial cells and stellate cells induced LXR-alpha via a synergistic NOTCH-BMP pathway.

Because of limitations of classical clustering methods, numerous alternative module detection methods have been proposed, which improve upon clustering by handling co-expression in only a subset of samples, modelling the regulatory network, and/or allowing overlap between modules. In this study we use known regulatory networks to do a comprehensive and robust evaluation of these different methods. Overall, decomposition methods outperform all other strategies, while we do not find a clear advantage of biclustering and network inference-based approaches on large gene expression datasets.

However, electron micrographs contain image degradations such as noise and blur caused by electromagnetic interference, electron counting errors, magnetic lens imperfections, electron diffraction, etc. These imperfections in raw image quality are inevitable and hamper subsequent image analysis and visualization. In an effort to mitigate these artefacts, many electron microscopy image restoration algorithms have been proposed in the last years. Most of these methods rely on generic assumptions on the image or degradations and are therefore outperformed by advanced methods that are based on more accurate models. Ideally, a method will accurately model the specific degradations that fit the physical acquisition settings. In this overview paper, we discuss different electron microscopy image degradation solutions and demonstrate that dedicated artefact regularisation results in higher quality restoration and is applicable through recently developed probabilistic methods.",

Targeting MALT1 proteolytic activity is of potential therapeutic interest. However, little is known about the evolutionary origin and the original functions of the CBM complex. Type 1 paracaspases originated before the last common ancestor of planulozoa (bilaterians and cnidarians). Notably in bilaterians, Ecdysozoa (e.g., nematodes and insects) lacks Bcl10, whereas other lineages have a Bcl10 homolog. A survey of invertebrate CARD-CC homologs revealed such homologs only in species with Bcl10, indicating an ancient common origin of the entire CBM complex. Furthermore, vertebrate-like Syk/Zap70 tyrosine kinase homologs with the ITAM-binding SH2 domain were only found in invertebrate organisms with CARD-CC/Bcl10, indicating that this pathway might be related to the original function of the CBM complex. Moreover, the type 1 paracaspase sequences from invertebrate organisms that have CARD-CC/Bcl10 are more similar to vertebrate paracaspases. Functional analysis of protein-protein interactions, NF-kappa B signaling, and CYLD cleavage for selected invertebrate type 1 paracaspase and Bcl10 homologs supports this scenario and indicates an ancient origin of the CARD-CC/Bcl10/paracaspase signaling complex. By contrast, many of the known MALT1-associated activities evolved fairly recently, indicating that unknown functions are at the basis of the protein conservation. As a proof-of-concept, we provide initial evidence for a CBM- and NF-kappa B-independent neuronal function of the Caenorhabditis elegans type 1 paracaspase malt-1. In conclusion, this study shows how evolutionary insights may point at alternative functions of MALT1.",

The core focus of the research community has been on binary-class imbalance, although there is a recent trend toward the general case of multi-class imbalanced data. The IFROWANN method, a classifier based on fuzzy rough set theory, stands out for its performance in two-class imbalanced problems. In this paper, we consider its extension to multi-class data by combining it with one-versus-one decomposition. The latter transforms a multi-class problem into two-class sub-problems. Binary classifiers are applied to these sub-problems, after which their outcomes are aggregated into one prediction. We enhance the integration of IFROWANN in the decomposition scheme in two steps. Firstly, we propose an adaptive weight setting for the binary classifier, addressing the varying characteristics of the sub-problems. We call this modified classifier IFROWANN-WIR. Second, we develop a new dynamic aggregation method called WV–FROST that combines the predictions of the binary classifiers with the global class affinity before making a final decision. In a meticulous experimental study, we show that our complete proposal outperforms the state-of-the-art on a wide range of multi-class imbalanced datasets.",

As part of a topology optimisation process, one could use graphlet counts to iteratively modify a network and keep track of the graphlet counts, in order to achieve certain topological properties. Up until now, however, graphlets were not suited as a metric for performing topology optimisation; when millions of minor changes are made to the network structure it becomes computationally intractable to recalculate all the graphlet counts for each of the edge modifications. \r\nResults : IncGraph is a method for calculating the differences in graphlet counts with respect to the network in its previous state, which is much more efficient than calculating the graphlet occurrences from scratch at every edge modification made. In comparison to static counting approaches, our findings show IncGraph reduces the execution time by several orders of magnitude. The usefulness of this approach was demonstrated by developing a graphlet-based metric to optimise gene regulatory networks. IncGraph is able to quickly quantify the topological impact of small changes to a network, which opens novel research opportunities to study changes in topologies in evolving or online networks, or develop graphlet-based criteria for topology optimisation. \r\nAvailability : IncGraph is freely available as an open-source R package on CRAN (incgraph).

The reason behind the regional and patchy distribution of arthritis represents a longstanding paradox. Here we show that biomechanical loading acts as a decisive factor in the transition from systemic autoimmunity to joint inflammation. Distribution of inflammation and erosive disease is confined to mechano-sensitive regions with a unique microanatomy. Curiously, this pathway relies on stromal cells but not adaptive immunity. Mechano-stimulation of mesenchymal cells induces CXCL1 and CCL2 for the recruitment of classical monocytes, which can differentiate into bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Genetic ablation of CCL2 or pharmacologic targeting of its receptor CCR2 abates mechanically-induced exacerbation of arthritis, indicating that stress-induced chemokine release by mesenchymal cells and chemo-attraction of monocytes determines preferential homing of arthritis to certain hot spots. Thus, mechanical strain controls the site-specific localisation of inflammation and tissue damage in arthritis.",

Although T cell reactivity to cardiac self-antigen is common in the disease, it is unknown which antigen presenting cell (ARC) triggers autoimmunity. Experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) was induced by immunizing mice with alpha-myosin loaded bone marrow APCs cultured in GM-CSF. APCs found in such cultures include conventional type 2 CD11b(+) cDCs (GM-cDC2s) and monocyte-derived cells (GM-MCs). However, only alpha-myosin loaded GM-cDC2s could induce EAM. We also studied antigen presenting capacity of endogenous type 1 CD24(+) cDCs (cDC1s), cDC2s, and MCs for alpha-myosin-specific TCR-transgenic TCR-M CD4(+) T cells. After EAM induction, all cardiac APCs significantly increased and cDCs migrated to the heart-draining mediastinal lymph node (LN). Primarily cDC2s presented alpha-myosin to TCR-M cells and induced Th1/Th17 differentiation. Loss of IRF4 in lrf4(fl)(/)(fl).Cd11 cCre mice reduced MHCII expression on GM-cDC2s in vitro and cDC2 migration in vivo. However, partly defective cDC2 functions in lrf4(fl)(/)(fl).Cd11 cCre mice did not suppress EAM. MCs were the largest APC subset in the inflamed heart and produced pro-inflammatory cytokines. Targeting APC populations could be exploited in the design of new therapies for cardiac autoimmunity.",

For example, the fruit fly and demosponge have only one nanos gene, zebrafish and humans have three, and Fugu rubripes has four. Nanos genes are mainly known for their evolutionarily preserved role in germ cell survival and pluripotency. Nanos proteins have been reported to bind the C-terminal RNA-binding domain of Pumilio to form a post-transcriptional repressor complex. Several observations point to a link between the miRNA-mediated repression complex and the Nanos/Pumilio complex. Repression of the E2F3 oncogene product is, indeed, mediated by cooperation between the Nanos/Pumilio complex and miRNAs. Another important interaction partner of Nanos is the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. Besides the tissue-specific contribution of Nanos proteins to normal development, their ectopic expression has been observed in several cancer cell lines and various human cancers. An inverse correlation between the expression levels of human Nanos1 and Nanos3 and E-cadherin was observed in several cancer cell lines. Loss of E-cadherin, an important cell-cell adhesion protein, contributes to tumor invasion and metastasis. Overexpression of Nanos3 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung cancer cell lines partly by repressing E-cadherin. Other than some most interesting data from Nanos knockout mice, little is known about mammalian Nanos proteins, and further research is needed. In this review, we summarize the main roles of Nanos proteins and discuss the emerging concept of Nanos proteins as oncofetal antigens.",

Fingerprints are grouped into disjoint classes, so that an input fingerprint is compared only with those belonging to the predicted class, reducing the penetration rate of the search. The classification procedure usually starts by the extraction of features from the fingerprint image, frequently based on visual characteristics. In this work, we propose an approach to fingerprint classification using convolutional neural networks, which avoid the necessity of an explicit feature extraction process by incorporating the image processing within the training of the classifier. Furthermore, such an approach is able to predict a class even for low-quality fingerprints that are rejected by commonly used algorithms, such as FingerCode. The study gives special importance to the robustness of the classification for different impressions of the same fingerprint, aiming to minimize the penetration in the database. In our experiments, convolutional neural networks yielded better accuracy and penetration rate than state-of-the-art classifiers based on explicit feature extraction. The tested networks also improved on the runtime, as a result of the joint optimization of both feature extraction and classification.",

Functionally interpreting these sequences and finding the biological signals that are hallmarks of gene function and regulation is currently mostly done using automated genome annotation platforms, which mainly rely on integrated machine learning frameworks to identify different functional sites of interest, including splice sites. Splicing is an essential step in the gene regulation process, and the correct identification of splice sites is a major cornerstone in a genome annotation system. \r\nResults: In this paper, we present SpliceRover, a predictive deep learning approach that outperforms the state-of-the-art in splice site prediction. SpliceRover uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been shown to obtain cutting edge performance on a wide variety of prediction tasks. We adapted this approach to deal with genomic sequence inputs, and show it consistently outperforms already existing approaches, with relative improvements in prediction effectiveness of up to 80.9% when measured in terms of false discovery rate. However, a major criticism of CNNs concerns their 'black box' nature, as mechanisms to obtain insight into their reasoning processes are limited. To facilitate interpretability of the SpliceRover models, we introduce an approach to visualize the biologically relevant information learnt. We show that our visualization approach is able to recover features known to be important for splice site prediction (binding motifs around the splice site, presence of polypyrimidine tracts and branch points), as well as reveal new features (e.g. several types of exclusion patterns near splice sites).",

The most notable features found are the Kozak consensus sequence, the reading frame characteristics, the influence of stop and start codons in the sequence, and the presence of donor splice site patterns.",

However, the conserved factors defining macrophages remain largely unknown. The transcription factor ZEB2 is best described for its role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition; however, its role within the immune system is only now being elucidated. We show here that Zeb2 expression is a conserved feature of macrophages. Using Clec4f-cre, Itgax-cre, and Fcgr1-cre mice to target five different macrophage populations, we found that loss of ZEB2 resulted in macrophage disappearance from the tissues, coupled with their subsequent replenishment from bone-marrow precursors in open niches. Mechanistically, we found that ZEB2 functioned to maintain the tissue-specific identities of macrophages. In Kupffer cells, ZEB2 achieved this by regulating expression of the transcription factor LXR alpha, removal of which recapitulated the loss of Kupffer cell identity and disappearance. Thus, ZEB2 expression is required in macrophages to preserve their tissue-specific identities.",

As the latter have recently been shown to be distinct from conventional NK cells and have innate lymphoid cell type 1 (ILC1) properties, we investigated Ly49E expression on intestinal ILC populations. Here, we show that Ly49E expression is very low on known ILC populations, but it can be used to define a previously unrecognized intraepithelial innate lymphoid population. This Ly49E-positive population is negative for NKp46 and CD8 alpha alpha, expresses CD49a and CD103, and requires T-bet expression and IL-15 signaling for differentiation and/or survival. Transcriptome analysis reveals a group 1 ILC gene profile, different from NK cells, iCD8 alpha cells, and intraepithelial ILC1. Importantly, NKp46(-)CD8 alpha alpha(-)Ly49E(+) cells produce interferon (IFN)-gamma, suggesting that this previously unrecognized population may contribute to Th1-mediated immunity.",

We investigated the mechanisms underlying multimorbidity between three main allergic diseases at a molecular level by identifying the proteins and cellular processes that are common to them. \r\nMethods : An in silico study based on computational analysis of the topology of the protein interaction network was performed in order to characterize the molecular mechanisms of multimorbidity of asthma, eczema and rhinitis. As a first step, proteins associated to either disease were identified using data mining approaches, and their overlap was calculated. Secondly, a functional interaction network was built, allowing to identify cellular pathways involved in allergic multimorbidity. Finally, a network-based algorithm generated a ranked list of newly predicted multimorbidity-associated proteins. \r\nResults : Asthma, eczema and rhinitis shared a larger number of associated proteins than expected by chance, and their associated proteins exhibited a significant degree of interconnectedness in the interaction network. There were 15 pathways involved in the multimorbidity of asthma, eczema and rhinitis, including IL4 signaling and GATA3-related pathways. A number of proteins potentially associated to these multimorbidity processes were also obtained. \r\nConclusions : These results strongly support the existence of an allergic multimorbidity cluster between asthma, eczema and rhinitis, and suggest that type 2 signaling pathways represent a relevant multimorbidity mechanism of allergic diseases. Furthermore, we identified new candidates contributing to multimorbidity that may assist in identifying new targets for multimorbid allergic diseases.",

Unlike small-scale gene duplications, whole-genome duplications (WGDs) copy entire pathways or networks, and as such create the unique situation in which such duplicated pathways or networks could evolve novel functionality through the coordinated sub-or neofunctionalization of its constituent genes. Here, we describe a remarkable case of coordinated gene expression divergence following WGDs in Arabidopsis thaliana. We identified a set of 92 homoeologous gene pairs that all show a similar pattern of tissue-specific gene expression divergence following WGD, with one homoeolog showing predominant expression in aerial tissues and the other homoeolog showing biased expression in tip-growth tissues. We provide evidence that this pattern of gene expression divergence seems to involve genes with a role in cell polarity and that likely function in the maintenance of cell wall integrity. Following WGD, many of these duplicated genes evolved separate functions through subfunctionalization in growth/development and stress response. Uncoupling these processes through genome duplications likely provided important adaptations with respect to growth and morphogenesis and defense against biotic and abiotic stress.",

More than 100 human cadherin superfamily members have been identified, which can be classified into three families: major cadherins, protocadherins and cadherin-related proteins. These superfamily members are involved in diverse fundamental cellular processes including cell-cell adhesion, morphogenesis, cell recognition and signaling. Epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) is the founding cadherin family member. Its cytoplasmic tail interacts with the armadillo catenins, p120 and beta-catenin. Further, alpha-catenin links the cadherin/armadillo catenin complex to the actin filament network. Even genomes of ancestral metazoan species such as cnidarians and placozoans encode a limited number of distinct cadherins and catenins, emphasizing the conservation and functional importance of these gene families. Moreover, a large expansion of the cadherin and catenin families coincides with the emergence of vertebrates and reflects a major functional diversification in higher metazoans. Here, we revisit and review the functions, phylogenetic classifications and co-evolution of the cadherin and catenin protein families.",

Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy (MeDALL; EU FP7-CP-IP; project no: 261357; 2010-2015) studied the complex links of allergic diseases at the clinical and mechanistic levels by linking epidemiologic, clinical, and mechanistic research, including in vivo and in vitro models. MeDALL integrated 14 European birth cohorts, including 44,010 participants and 160 cohort follow-ups between pregnancy and age 20 years. Thirteen thousand children were prospectively followed after puberty by using a newly standardized MeDALL Core Questionnaire. A microarray developed for allergen molecules with increased IgE sensitivity was obtained for 3,292 children. Estimates of air pollution exposure from previous studies were available for 10,000 children. Omics data included those from historical genome-wide association studies (23,000 children) and DNA methylation (2,173), targeted multiplex biomarker (1,427), and transcriptomic (723) studies. Using classical epidemiology and machine-learning methods in 16,147 children aged 4 years and 11,080 children aged 8 years, MeDALL showed the multimorbidity of eczema, rhinitis, and asthma and estimated that only 38% of multimorbidity was attributable to IgE sensitization. MeDALL has proposed a new vision of multimorbidity independent of IgE sensitization, and has shown that monosensitization and polysensitization represent 2 distinct phenotypes. The translational component of MeDALL is shown by the identification of a novel allergic phenotype characterized by polysensitization and multimorbidity, which is associated with the frequency, persistence, and severity of allergic symptoms. The results of MeDALL will help integrate personalized, predictive, preventative, and participatory approaches in allergic diseases.",

This superhelical armadillo structure enables them to interact with distinct partners by wrapping around them. Despite the important functional roles of this superfamily, a comprehensive analysis of the composition, classification, and phylogeny of this protein superfamily has not been reported. Furthermore, relatively little is known about a subset of ARM proteins, and some of the current annotations of armadillo repeats are incomplete or incorrect, often due to high similarity with HEAT repeats. We identified the entire armadillo repeat superfamily repertoire in the human genome, annotated each armadillo repeat, and performed an extensive evolutionary analysis of the armadillo repeat proteins in both metazoan and premetazoan species. Phylogenetic analyses of the superfamily classified them into several discrete branches with members showing significant sequence homology, and often also related functions. Interestingly, the phylogenetic structure of the superfamily revealed that about 30 % of the members predate metazoans and represent an ancient subset, which is gradually evolving to acquire complex and highly diverse functions.",

Sterile tissue injury can break peripheral tolerance, but it is unclear how autoreactive T cells get activated in response to self. An example of a sterile injury is myocardial infarction (MI). We hypothesized that tissue necrosis is an activator of dendritic cells (DCs), which control tolerance to self-antigens. DC subsets of a murine healthy heart consisted of IRF8-dependent conventional (c) DC1, IRF4-dependent cDC2, and monocyte-derived DCs. In steady state, cardiac self-antigen alpha-myosin was presented in the heart-draining mediastinal lymph node (mLN) by cDC1s, driving the proliferation of antigen-specific CD4(+) TCR-M T cells and their differentiation into regulatory cells (Tregs). Following MI, all DC subsets infiltrated the heart, whereas only cDCs migrated to the mLN. Here, cDC2s induced TCR-M proliferation and differentiation into interleukin-(IL)-17/interferon-(IFN) gamma-producing effector cells. Thus, cardiac-specific autoreactive T cells get activated by mature DCs following myocardial infarction.",

Deletion of Tgfbr1 results in markedly fewer intestinal CD103(+)CD11b(+) DCs and a reciprocal increase in the CD103(-)CD11b(+) dendritic cell subset.

Tgfbr1(fl/fl) mice reflects defective differentiation from CD103(-)CD11b(+) intermediaries, rather than an isolated loss of CD103 expression. The defect in CD103(+)CD11b(+) DCs is accompanied by reduced generation of antigen-specific, inducible FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells in vitro and in vivo, and by reduced numbers of endogenous Th17 cells in the intestinal mucosa.

However, recent advances in the field of RNA sequencing revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) add an extensive additional layer to the cell’s molecular network. Here, we performed transcriptome profiling throughout a primary HIV infection in vitro to investigate lncRNA expression at the different HIV replication cycle processes (reverse transcription, integration and particle production). Subsequently, guilt-by-association, transcription factor and co-expression analysis were performed to infer biological roles for the lncRNAs identified in the HIV-host interplay. Many lncRNAs were suggested to play a role in mechanisms relying on proteasomal and ubiquitination pathways, apoptosis, DNA damage responses and cell cycle regulation. Through transcription factor binding analysis, we found that lncRNAs display a distinct transcriptional regulation profile as compared to protein coding mRNAs, suggesting that mRNAs and lncRNAs are independently modulated. In addition, we identified five differentially expressed lncRNA-mRNA pairs with mRNA involvement in HIV pathogenesis with possible cis regulatory lncRNAs that control nearby mRNA expression and function. Altogether, the present study demonstrates that lncRNAs add a new dimension to the HIV-host interplay and should be further investigated as they may represent targets for controlling HIV replication.",

They have been shown to influence research results, explain phenotypical differences between inbred strains, and increase the amount of interesting gene variants present in the many available inbred lines. SPRET/Ei is an inbred strain derived from Mus spretus that has similar to 1% sequence difference with the C57BL/6J reference genome. We obtained a listing of all SNPs and insertions/deletions (indels) present in SPRET/Ei from the Mouse Genomes Project (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute) and processed these data to obtain an overview of all transcripts having nonsynonymous coding sequence variants. We identified 8,883 unique variants affecting 10,096 different transcripts from 6,328 protein-coding genes, which is about 28% of all coding genes. Because only a subset of these variants results in drastic changes in proteins, we focused on variations that are nonsense mutations that ultimately resulted in a gain of a stop codon. These genes were identified by in silico changing the C57BL/6J coding sequences to the SPRET/Ei sequences, converting them to amino acid (AA) sequences, and comparing the AA sequences. All variants and transcripts affected were also stored in a database, which can be browsed using a SPRET/Ei M. spretus variants web tool (www.spretus.org), including a manual. We validated the tool by demonstrating the loss of function of three proteins predicted to be severely truncated, namely Fas, IRAK2, and IFN gamma R1.",

In classification problems, a decision value is assigned to the entire bag, and the classification of an unseen bag involves the prediction of the decision value based on the instances it contains. In this paper, we develop a framework for multi-instance classifiers based on fuzzy set theory. Fuzzy sets have been used in many machine learning applications, but so far not in the classification of multi-instance data. We explore its untapped potential here. We interpret the classes as fuzzy sets and determine membership degrees of unseen bags to these sets based on the available training data. In doing so, we develop a framework of classifiers that extract the required membership degrees either at the level of instances (instance-based) or at the level of bags (bag-based). We offer an extensive analysis of the different settings within the proposed framework. We experimentally compare our proposal to state-of-the-art multi-instance classifiers, and based on two evaluation measures, our methods are shown to perform very well.",

We generated DC-specific Gatal knockout mice (Gatal-KODc), which presented a 20% reduction of splenic DCs, partially explained by enhanced apoptosis. RNA sequencing analysis revealed a number of deregulated genes involved in cell survival, migration, and function. DC migration toward peripheral lymph nodes was impaired in Gatal-KODc mice. Migration assays performed in vitro showed that this defect was selective for CCL21, but not CCL19. Interestingly, we show that Gatal-KODc DCs have reduced polysialic acid levels on their surface, which is a known determinant for the proper migration of DCs toward CCL21.",

In monocytes, IRF8 was necessary during early but not late development. Complete or late deletion of IRF8 had no effect on pDC development or survival but altered their phenotype and gene-expression profile leading to increased T cell stimulatory function but decreased type 1 interferon production.

            "abstract": "Background: Many algorithms have been developed to infer the topology of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data. These methods typically produce a ranking of links between genes with associated confidence scores, after which a certain threshold is chosen to produce the inferred topology. However, the structural properties of the predicted network do not resemble those typical for a gene regulatory network, as most algorithms only take into account connections found in the data and do not include known graph properties in their inference process. This lowers the prediction accuracy of these methods, limiting their usability in practice.\r\n \r\nResults: We propose a post-processing algorithm which is applicable to any confidence ranking of regulatory interactions obtained from a network inference method which can use, inter alia, graphlets and several graph-invariant properties to re-rank the links into a more accurate prediction. To demonstrate the potential of our approach, we re-rank predictions of six different state-of-the-art algorithms using three simple network properties as optimization criteria and show that Netter can improve the predictions made on both artificially generated data as well as the DREAM4 and DREAM5 benchmarks. Additionally, the DREAM5 E. coli. community prediction inferred from real expression data is further improved. Furthermore, Netter compares favorably to other post-processing algorithms and is not restricted to correlation-like predictions. Lastly, we demonstrate that the performance increase is robust for a wide range of parameter settings. Netter is available at http://bioinformatics. intec. ugent. be.\r\n \r\nConclusions: Network inference from high-throughput data is a long-standing challenge. In this work, we present Netter, which can further refine network predictions based on a set of user-defined graph properties. Netter is a flexible system which can be applied in unison with any method producing a ranking from omics data. It can be tailored to specific prior knowledge by expert users but can also be applied in general uses cases. Concluding, we believe that Netter is an interesting second step in the network inference process to further increase the quality of prediction.",

MeDALL has linked epidemiological, clinical and basic research using a stepwise, large-scale and integrative approach: MeDALL data of precisely phenotyped children followed in 14 birth cohorts spread across Europe were combined with systems biology (omics, IgE measurement using microarrays) and environmental data. Multimorbidity in the same child is more common than expected by chance alone, suggesting that these diseases share causal mechanisms irrespective of IgE sensitization. IgE sensitization should be considered differently in monosensitized and polysensitized individuals. Allergic multimorbidities and IgE polysensitization are often associated with the persistence or severity of allergic diseases. Environmental exposures are relevant for the development of allergy-related diseases. To complement the population-based studies in children, MeDALL included mechanistic experimental animal studies and in vitro studies in humans. The integration of multimorbidities and polysensitization has resulted in a new classification framework of allergic diseases that could help to improve the understanding of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of allergy as well as to better manage allergic diseases.

We aimed at developing a robust transcription-based signature for biodosimetry from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells irradiated with different doses of X-rays (0.1 and 1.0 Gy) at a dose rate of 0.26 Gy/min. Genome-wide radiation-induced changes in mRNA expression were evaluated at both gene and exon level. Using exon-specific qRT-PCR, we confirmed that several biomarker genes are alternatively spliced or transcribed after irradiation and that different exons of these genes exhibit significantly different levels of induction. Moreover, a significant number of radiation-responsive genes were found to be genomic neighbors. Using three different classification models we found that gene and exon signatures performed equally well on dose prediction, as long as more than 10 features are included. Together, our results highlight the necessity of evaluating gene expression at the level of single exons for radiation biodosimetry in particular and transcriptional biomarker research in general. This approach is especially advisable for practical gene expression-based biodosimetry, for which primer-or probe-based techniques would be the method of choice.",

Several transcription factors (TFs) have been implicated in regulating the development of pDCs (E2-2 and Id2) and cDC1s (Irf8, Id2, and Batf3); however, those required for the early commitment of pre-cDCs toward the cDC2 lineage are unknown. Here, we identify the TF zinc finger E box-binding homeobox 2 (Zeb2) to play a crucial role in regulating DC development. Zeb2 was expressed from the pre-pDC and pre-cDC stage onward and highly expressed in mature pDCs and cDC2s. Mice conditionally lacking Zeb2 in CD11c(+) cells had a cell-intrinsic reduction in pDCs and cDC2s, coupled with an increase in cDC1s. Conversely, mice in which CD11c(+) cells overexpressed Zeb2 displayed a reduction in cDC1s. This was accompanied by altered expression of Id2, which was up-regulated in cDC2s and pDCs from conditional knock-out mice. Zeb2 chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed Id2 to be a direct target of Zeb2. Thus, we conclude that Zeb2 regulates commitment to both the cDC2 and pDC lineages through repression of Id2.",

We simultaneously transferred traceable YS-Macs, FL-MOs, and BM-MOs into the empty alveolar macrophage (AM) niche of neonatal Csf2rb(-/-) mice. All subsets produced AMs, but in competition preferential outgrowth of FL-MOs was observed, correlating with their superior granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) reactivity and proliferation capacity. When transferred separately, however, all precursors efficiently colonized the alveolar niche and generated AMs that were transcriptionally almost identical, self-maintained, and durably prevented alveolar proteinosis. Mature liver, peritoneal, or colon macrophages could not efficiently colonize the empty AM niche, whereas mature AMs could.

They are associated with allergen-specific IgE and nonallergic mechanisms that may coexist in the same patient. In addition, these diseases tend to cluster and patients present concomitant or consecutive diseases (multimorbidity). IgE sensitization should be considered as a quantitative trait. Important clinical and immunological differences exist between mono- and polysensitized subjects. Multimorbidities of allergic diseases share common causal mechanisms that are only partly IgE-mediated. Persistence of allergic diseases over time is associated with multimorbidity and/or IgE polysensitization. The importance of the family history of allergy may decrease with age. This review puts forward the hypothesis that allergic multimorbidities and IgE polysensitization are associated and related to the persistence or re-occurrence of foetal type 2 signalling. Asthma, rhinitis and AD are manifestations of a common systemic immune imbalance (mesodermal origin) with specific patterns of remodelling (ectodermal or endodermal origin). This study proposes a new classification of IgE-mediated allergic diseases that allows the definition of novel phenotypes to (i) better understand genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, (ii) better stratify allergic preschool children for prognosis and (iii) propose novel strategies of treatment and prevention.",

However, PCR amplification of these marker genes produces a significant amount of artificial sequences, often referred to as chimeras. Different algorithms have been developed to remove these chimeras, but efforts to combine different methodologies are limited. Therefore, two machine learning classifiers (reference-based and de novo CATCh) were developed by integrating the output of existing chimera detection tools into a new, more powerful method. When comparing our classifiers with existing tools in either the reference-based or de novo mode, a higher performance of our ensemble method was observed on a wide range of sequencing data, including simulated, 454 pyrosequencing, and Illumina MiSeq data sets. Since our algorithm combines the advantages of different individual chimera detection tools, our approach produces more robust results when challenged with chimeric sequences having a low parent divergence, short length of the chimeric range, and various numbers of parents. Additionally, it could be shown that integrating CATCh in the preprocessing pipeline has a beneficial effect on the quality of the clustering in operational taxonomic units.",

We tested the sensitivity of our estimates to subject and variable selections, and to different statistical approaches, including latent class analysis and self-organizing maps.\r\nResults: Two groups were identified as the optimal way to cluster the data at both age periods and in all sensitivity analyses. The first (reference) group at 4 and 8years (including 70% and 79% of children, respectively) was characterized by a low prevalence of symptoms and sensitization, whereas the second (symptomatic) group exhibited more frequent symptoms and sensitization. Ninety-nine percentage of children with comorbidities (co-occurrence of asthma, rhinitis and/or eczema) were included in the symptomatic group at both ages. The children's characteristics in both groups were consistent in all sensitivity analyses.\r\nConclusion: At 4 and 8years, at the population level, asthma, rhinitis and eczema can be classified together as an allergic comorbidity cluster. Future research including time-repeated assessments and biological data will help understanding the interrelationships between these diseases.",
